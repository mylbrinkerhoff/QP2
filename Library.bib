Thus, for the first time, English-speaking readers will have a text of the Quran which is easy to use and comprehensible. Furthermore, Haleem includes notes that explain geographical, historical, and personal allusions as well as an index in which Quranic material is arranged into topics for easy reference. His introduction traces the history of the Quran, examines its structure and stylistic features, and considers issues related to militancy, intolerance, and the subjection of women},

Since that time, hundreds of studies have used this method. Here, we review the original definition of VOT, propose some extensions to the definition, and discuss some problematic cases. We propose a set of terms for the most important aspects of VOT and a set of Praat labels that could provide some consistency for future cross-study analyses. Although additions of other aspects of realization of voicing distinctions (F0, amplitude, duration of voicelessness) could be considered, they are rejected as adding too much complexity for what has turned out to be one of the most frequently used metrics in phonetics and phonology.},

  abstract = {Chukchansi belongs to the Yokuts language family (ISO 639 code: yok) ancestrally spoken in the San Joaquin valley of Central California and in the adjacent foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The headquarters of the Chukchansi tribe is located in Coarsegold and many members of the tribe live in and around Madera and Fresno counties. As shown in the map in Figure~1, there are three major territories of the Yokuts: Northern Valley Yokuts, Foothill Yokuts, and Southern Valley Yokuts. While the territory of the Chukchansi is in the foothills area, the dialect is linguistically Northern Valley (Whistler \& Golla 1986), as shown in Figure~2. Yawelmani, a Yokuts language that has been a subject of extensive linguistic research (e.g. Newman 1944, Archangeli 1983, Weigel 2005), is a dialect of the Southern Valley Yokuts. It is unclear to what extent Yokuts varieties are mutually intelligible. Yokuts is often considered to be a part of a larger Penutian language family (e.g. Dixon \& Kroeber 1913, Sapir 1921, DeLancey \& Golla 1997). While the status of Penutian as a macro-family is disputed, Yokuts is very likely related to the Miwok and Costanoan language families of California (Callaghan 1997).},

  abstract = {Zapotec languages are known for their complex tonal and phonation systems. Fieldwork in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (SLZ), an undocumented language spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico, suggests the implementation of six tones (high, mid, low, high-falling, mid-falling and rising) and four phonation types (modal, creaky, checked and breathy). We report on the reliability of acoustic measures such as (H1-H2) and (H1-A1), which have previously been reported to characterize phonation types. Spectral measurements including H1, H2 (first and second harmonics), A1 (amplitude of F1) and A2 (amplitude of F2) are taken from vowels in near minimal pairs controlled for tones and quality. We also report on the relative implementation of tone and phonation. Silverman (1997) argues that languages with contrastive tone and phonation optimize the realization of laryngeal events such that non-modal vowels have a modal portion where the tonal event is implemented. We discuss if Silverman’s predictions are borne out in SLZ.},

  abstract = {In the present study, children's early ability to organise words into sentences was investigated using the Weird Word Order procedure with Spanish-speaking children. Spanish is a language that allows for more flexibility in the positions of subjects and objects, with respect to verbs, than other previously studied languages (English, French, and Japanese). As in prior studies (Abbot-Smith et al., 2001; Chang et al., 2009; Franck et al., 2011; Matthews et al., 2005, 2007), we manipulated the relative frequency of verbs in training sessions with two age groups (three- and four-year-old children). Results supported earlier findings with regard to frequency: children produced atypical word orders significantly more often with infrequent verbs than with frequent verbs. The findings from the present study support probabilistic learning models which allow higher levels of flexibility and, in turn, oppose hypotheses that defend early access to advanced grammatical knowledge.},

  abstract = {Since the Conservativity Universal (Barwise \&amp; Cooper 1981; Keenan \&amp; Stavi 1986) has been proposed for natural language determiners, several apparent counterexamples have been presented in the literature. Some of these, such as English only in Only students presented, have been argued to involve an adverbial structure, thus not violating Conservativity. In this paper, we focus on proportional quantifiers such as 70\% in Korean, which have been shown to have a non- conservative reading when floated out of the DP (Ahn \&amp; Sauerland 2017). While Ahn \&amp; Sauerland (2017) assume that floated quantifiers are adnominal, Korean floated quantifiers have been shown to have both adnominal and adverbial variants (Ko 2014), thus leaving open the possibility that the non-conservative reading is simply resulting from an adverbial structure, like only. We test out the predictions of the adnominal and the adverbial accounts of non-conservative quantifiers in Korean. Our results show that floating quantifiers in non-conservative contexts a) cannot be definite-marked, and b) cannot be intervened by a vP-internal (low) adverbial, both of which are predicted if the non-conservative quantifier is adnominal, but not if it is adverbial. Based on these findings, we conclude that the non-conservative proportional quantifiers in Korean involve adnominal floating quantifiers. Our study thus makes a novel case for the claim that syntactic movement can be implicated in order to explain a non-conservative construal of a quantifier in languages under the Conservativity Universal.},

They concern the extent of phonetic merger (the completeness question) and the empirical validity of the phonetic effect (the genuineness question). Regarding the completeness question, I present acoustic and perceptual analyses of vowel/zero alternations in Bedouin Hijazi Arabic (BHA) that appear to result in neutralisation. The phonology of these alternations exemplifies two neutralisation scenarios bearing on the completeness question. Until now, these scenarios have been investigated separately within small-scale studies. Here I look more closely at both, testing hypotheses involving the acoustics-perception relation and the phonetics-phonology relation.},

However, many environmental and psychosocial factors can impact the quality of parent–child language and literacy interactions as well as training program outcomes. This preliminary randomized controlled trial examined maternal perceived self-efficacy and locus of control during a language and literacy parent training program. Thirty mother–child dyads (mother age 21–40; children 2;6–4;0) were assigned in parallel to the training or control group. The training was efficacious for mothers and children – training-group dyads made significantly greater gains in maternal strategy use, responsivity, and child print awareness than the control group. Gains were maintained one month post-training. Children whose mothers had more external baseline control perceptions identified significantly fewer print targets at baseline and made greater gains than those with more internal control perceptions. Future directions and implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we compare the properties of dative and genitive objects in Classical vs. Modern Greek. Based on the difference in behavior of dative/genitive objects of ditransitives and monadic transitives in the two periods of Greek which correlates with a range of systematic alternations in the case realization of Modern Greek IO arguments depending on the presence and category (DP vs. PP) of lower theme arguments, we argue that there are two distinct modes of dative and genitive objective case assignment: they are either prepositional or dependent (structural) cases, as also proposed by Baker and Vinokurova (2010), and Baker (2015) on the basis of cross-linguistic evidence. If we adopt this proposal a number of important implications follow both for the syntax of Modern Greek genitive indirect objects and for the understanding of the change from Classical to Standard Modern Greek which must be seen as a development from a grammatical system where dative and genitive were lexical/inherent/prepositional cases to a system where genitive is a dependent case assigned to DPs in the sense of Marantz (1991). Interestingly, the development from Classical Greek (CG) to Modern Greek (MG) affected the availability of dative/genitive-nominative alternations in passivization, in the opposite direction of what might be expected, i.e. such alternations were possible in CG and are no longer possible in MG. Our paper addresses this puzzle and argues that the availability of such alternations is not always a diagnostic tool for detecting whether an indirect object DP bears lexically specified or structural/dependent Case, contra standard practice in the literature.},

In this paper, we consider the use of wal across a broader range of environments, arguing for a complex picture of wal as a discourse particle as well as its interactions with other factors. First, we show that the semantic effect of wal differs systematically depending on its intonational realization. Second, we show that both intonational variants of wal are felicitous across a wide variety of sentence types, not just declaratives. Overall, we present an analysis in which stressed and unstressed variants of wal interact with different sentence types in principled ways to produce a range of apparent effects. Beyond furthering our understanding of these various elements in Yucatec Maya, the resulting picture contributes to our growing cross-linguistic understanding of discourse particles and their interactions with intonation.},

Such phenomena are commonly limited to rather small corners of a language's structure, however, and as a result have not been a major theoretical focus. This paper examines a set of alternations in Surmiran, a Swiss Rumantsch language, that have this character and that pervade the entire system of the language. It is shown that the alternations in question, best attested in the verbal system, are not conditioned by any coherent set of morphological properties (either straightforwardly or in the extended sense of ‘morphomes' explored in other Romance languages by Maiden). These alternations are, however, straightforwardly aligned with the location of stress in words, and an analysis is proposed within the general framework of Optimality Theory to express this.

  abstract = {This article reports on a syntactic acceptability judgement study of 59 adult L2/Ln learners of Norwegian and a group of native controls, studying subject and object shift. These constructions involve movement of (mainly) pronominal subjects or objects across negation/adverbs. Both subject shift and object shift display considerable micro-variation in terms of syntax and information structure, dependent on factors such as nominal type (pronoun vs. full DP), function (subject vs. object), and information status (given vs. new/focused). Previous studies have shown that Norwegian children have an early preference for the unshifted position in both constructions, but that they acquire subject shift relatively early (before age 3). Object shift, on the other hand, is typically not in place until after age 6–7. Importantly, children are conservative learners, and never shift elements that should not move in the adult language. The results of the current study show that L2/Ln learners do not make all the fine distinctions that children make, in that they have a clear preference for all subjects in shifted position and all objects in unshifted position, although some distinctions fall into place with increased proficiency. Importantly, unlike children, the L2/Ln learners are not conservative learners; rather, they over-accept syntactic movement in several cases. The equivalent to this in language production would be to apply syntactic movement where it is not attested in the target language, which would be the opposite behaviour to that observed in L1 children.},

Green Mong is a tone language with an inventory of 7 contrastive tones and a tonal system that incorporates both fundamental frequency (FO) and phonation type distinctions. The study examines 3 Green Mong tones, which have similar FO contours and are characterized by the distinctive use of breathy, creaky and modal phonation. Acoustic analyses of 3 male and 3 female speakers' productions indicate that the tones are distinguished by their FO, relative amplitude of lower and higher harmonics (H1-H2), vowel duration, vowel quality and voice onset times. Discriminant analyses, used to estimate the relative value of these different cues, indicate that H1-H2 is the best predictor of tone category membership. This is the case for both high and low vowels, although the magnitude of the H1-H2 difference is substantially smaller for high vowels. The 2 predictor variables which are next most strongly correlated with the discriminant functions also relate to phonation type. However, FO does continue to play a role in classification of tokens into tone categories.},

We analyse narratives from 17 parent–child dyads, living in one such area. All children, aged 3–6;4, had high exposure to the local variety of Irish. The input quality was measured by specifying consistency and accuracy of use of morphosyntactic forms in parental narratives directed to their children. The same morphosyntactic forms were analysed in narrative retell by the children. The children produced with high accuracy those forms that the parents used consistently and accurately. For the forms where parents’ usage was inconsistent, large variation in the children's usage was observed. The findings suggest that consistency and accuracy in the use of morphosyntactic forms in the parental language is an important factor in language acquisition; however, its influence might be confounded by other factors.},

  abstract = {Alternations that are partly phonologically, partly morphologically conditioned are a central problem in phonological theory. In Optimality Theory, two types of solutions have been proposed: morphologically specialized phonological constraints (interface constraints) and different constraint rankings for different morphological categories (cophonologies). This paper presents empirical evidence that distinguishes between these two hypotheses. Stem-final vowel alternations in Finnish are governed by a mixed set of conditions that range from purely phonological to morphological and lexical, from ironclad exceptionless regularities to quantitative tendencies. Using a standard dictionary as the data base, we show that phonological conditioning plays the dominant role, but in cases where phonology underdetermines the output, morphological conditioning may emerge. We then show that partial ordering of constraints, commonly used to model variation, extends to morphological conditioning as well. The partial ordering model is a restrictive version of the cophonology model, which is thus supported.},

  abstract = {Recent work on elliptical forms of the English imperative has drawn quite heavily upon the apparent parallel between tag formation in imperatives and tag formation in interrogatives. Thus, it has been argued that the auxiliary in imperatives must be               will               because in all interrogative tag formations the auxiliary element in the appended tag is the same as the one occurring in the initial segment (Klima, 1964: 254; Postal, 1966; Katz \& Postal, 1964). The invited comparison is between tag-interrogatives like (1) John did it, didn't he? (2) They can do it, can't they? (3) He can't do that to us, can he? (4) You will try harder, won't you? and putative imperatives like (5) Do it now, will you! (6) Bring me a slab, won't you! (7) Bring me a slab, will you! (8) You will try harder, won't you! Consideration of such examples makes it fairly evident that, in the cases of the elliptical constructions (5)–(7)               aux Will               has been deleted from the initial segment and hence occurred in the deep structures serving as the sources for these constructions. Moreover, such parallels provide good motivation for the conjecture that ALL imperatives eventually derive from underlying sources whose phrasemarkers contain the element               will               (Postal, 1966: 162; Katz \& Postal, 1964: 75). It is my purpose here to attempt an analysis of the putative parallel between tag-imperatives and tag-questions in order to determine the extent to which it supports such conjectures about the specific nature of structures underlying English imperatives.},

  abstract = {To what extent do complex phonological patterns require the postulation of universal mechanisms specific to language? In this volume, we explore the Emergent Hypothesis, that the innate language-specific faculty driving the shape of adult grammars is minimal, with grammar development relying instead on cognitive capacities of a general nature. Generalisations about sounds, and about the way sounds are organised into meaningful units, are constructed in a bottom-up fashion: As such, phonology is emergent. We present arguments for considering the Emergent Hypothesis, both conceptually and by working through an extended example in order to demonstrate how an adult grammar might emerge from the input encountered by a learner. Developing a concrete, data-driven approach, we argue that the conventional, abstract notion of unique underlying representations is unmotivated; such underlying representations would require some innate principle to ensure their postulation by a learner. We review the history of the concept and show that such postulated forms result in undesirable phonological consequences. We work through several case studies to illustrate how various types of phonological patterns might be accounted for in the proposed framework. The case studies illustrate patterns of allophony, of productive and unproductive patterns of alternation, and cases where the surface manifestation of a feature does not seem to correspond to its morphological source. We consider cases where a phonetic distinction that is binary seems to manifest itself in a way that is morphologically ternary, and we consider cases where underlying representations of considerable abstractness have been posited in previous frameworks. We also consider cases of opacity, where observed phonological properties do not neatly map onto the phonological generalisations governing patterns of alternation.},

  abstract = {The variety described here is Pontic Greek (ISO 639 name: pnt), and specifically the variety that originates from Trapezounta in Asia Minor (present-day Trabzon in Turkey) as spoken today in Etoloakarnania, Greece by second-generation refugees. The term ‘Pontic Greek’ (in Greek: ) was originally an etic term, while Pontians called their language by other names, mainly [ɾoˈmeika]  ‘Romeika’ (Sitaridou 2016) but also [laziˈka]  ‘Laz language’ (Drettas 1997: 19, 620), even though Pontians and Laz people do not share the same language, the latter being Caucasian. Nowadays, is the standard term used not only by researchers, but also by native speakers of Pontic Greek born in Greece to refer to their variety (but see Sitaridou 2013 for Romeyka in the Black Sea). Pontic Greek belongs to the Asia Minor Greek group along with other varieties, such as Cappadocian Greek (e.g. Horrocks 2010: 398–404; Sitaridou 2014: 31). According to Sitaridou (2014, 2016), on the basis of historical reconstruction, the Pontic branch of Asia Minor Greek is claimed to have been divided into two major dialectal groups: Pontic Greek as spoken by Christians until the 20th century in Turkey and Romeyka as spoken by Muslims to date in Turkey. Triantafyllidis (1938/1981: 288) divides Pontic varieties, as were spoken in Asia Minor, into three dialectal groups, namely Oinountian, Chaldiot, and Trapezountian, the latter consisting of the varieties that were spoken at Trapezounta, Kerasounta, Rizounta, Sourmena, Ofis, Livera, Tripolis, and Matsouka in Asia Minor (Trabzon, Giresun, Sürmene, Of, Yazlık, Tirebolu, and Maçka respectively in present-day Turkey). However, Triantafyllidis does not explain his criteria for this classification (Chatzissavidis 2012). According to one other classification (Papadopoulos 1955: 17–18; Papadopoulos 1958: ), the variety that was used in Trapezounta belongs to the dialectal group in which post-stressed /i/ and /u/ delete along other varieties, such as e.g. the ones that were spoken in Chaldia (present-day Gümüşhane), Sourmena, and Ofis (as opposed to the rest of Pontic varieties, such as the one of Kerasounta, in which those vowels are retained). Trapezountian Pontic Greek can also be classified with the group of varieties that retain word-final /n/, such as the varieties of Kerasounta and Chaldia, as opposed to the varieties that do not retain it, such as the ones of Oinoe (present-day Ünye) and (partially) Ofis (Papadopoulos 1958: θ).},

  abstract = {The paper discusses the historical origin, present day distribution and prosodic status of preaspiration in Icelandic. Having developed as a movement of the openness of the glottis, originally a feature of “hard” stops, towards the nucleus of the stressed syllable, its distribution must be accounted for by a “segmental” rule operating on historical (underlying) hard stops. Its status with respect to length and stress is, however, shown to be that of a prosody of the nucleus of the Modern Icelandic syllable, since it carries length when the syllable is stressed. The development of preaspiration is seen as a part of a more general rule also responsible for voiceless sonorants and fricatives in the nucleus.},

It was carried out on a corpus of longitudinal dense dyadic interactions of two Hebrew-speaking toddlers aged 1;8–2;2 and their parents. Findings revealed correlated patterns within and between CDS and CS corpora in terms of verbs, structural root categories, and their components (roots, binyan conjugations, and derivational verb families), and clear relations between lexical-derivational development and inflectional growth in input–output relations, measured by MSP. It also showed that both corpora had few, yet highly semantically coherent, derivational families. Lexical learning in Hebrew was shown to be morphologically oriented, with both inflectional and derivational learning supporting and being supported by the development of the verb lexicon. These findings support findings in the general literature regarding the close relationship between parental input and child speech, and the affinity between lexical and grammatical growth.},

  abstract = {Languages where phonation type and tone are contrastive make use of extremely fine and controlled actions of laryngeal structures; hence, there is little opportunity to variation in either phonation or pitch. Nonetheless, many American Indian languages have contrastive nonmodal phonation, which, moreover, is subject to a great deal of variation. There are a few studies addressing the phonetics of nonmodal phonation in American Indian languages, and little is known about the phonetics/phonology interface of laryngeal features within the sound patterns of these languages. This article aims to contribute to the knowledge of nonmodal phonation through the detailed study of the phenomenon in Yalálag Zapotec (YZ) and American Indian language. A series of spectral and electrophysiological analyses contribute to the description of YZ nonmodal phonation and its variability across gender. It is argued that the temporal patterns in realization of laryngealization are a property of YZ speaker's grammar.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is primarily intended as a description of the Yalálag Zapotec (YZ) language of Oaxaca, México, with particular reference to its phonetic structures. The first section is an introduction to the Yalálag Zapotec language, its orthography and basic facts of its grammar. Chapter 2 outlines the noun and verb morphology, and Chapter 3 presents a sketch of sentence structure. The second section provides a detailed description of the phonetic structures of the language. Chapter 4 deals with vowels, consonants and tone. The YZ five modal vowels and four laryngealized vowels are described here. The phonetic properties of consonants are also presented, including the phonetic correlates of the fortis-lenis contrast. It is shown that VOT is a reliable parameter for obstruents; the phonetics of obstruent devoicing and consonant clusters are discussed. A description of the three contrastive tones in YZ closes the chapter. YZ data supports the typology of contour tone restrictions based on the weight of the rime: more sonorous and longer rimes are capable of bearing Falling tone; however, Falling tone can occur in non-sonorous rimes. Chapter 5 offers an analysis of vowel phonation, describing in detail the acoustic properties of modal and laryngealized vowels. The analysis shows that the time course of phonation in YZ is restricted to the edges of the vowel. This pattern suggests that the timing of nonmodal phonation is organized to guarantee the production and perception of multiple phonemic features that could otherwise contradict each other in actual implementation. Chapter 6 presents a palatographic and acoustic study of YZ coronals, denti-alveolars, postalveolars and alveo-palatals. The compression of coronal consonants in a narrow articulatory space allows us to observe the degree of variability in their production. The third section is composed of two chapters devoted to an investigation of the perception of tone in YZ. Chapter 7 investigates whether the perception of tone in YZ is categorical. Chapter 8 presents a dichotic listening experiment concerning the perception of linguistic and non-linguistic pitch in YZ. The results do not support a categorical perception of tone and show a consistent right ear advantage for lexical tone.},

GAMs enable the analyst to investigate non-linear functional relations between a response variable and one or more predictors. Furthermore, GAMs provide a principled framework for studying interactions involving two or more numeric predictors. GAMs are an extension of the generalized linear model, and can therefore be used not only for Gaussian response variables, but also for binomial and Poisson response variables (and many others). Corpus linguists will find GAMs useful for coming to a detailed understanding of nonlinear patterns in their data, which can range from historical change (Ellegård 1953) to the effects of corpus-based measures on acceptability ratings (Baayen and Divjak 2017).},

Elements are unlike traditional features in several respects: they have only positive values, they represent categories motivated solely by phonological behavior, they map on to acoustic patterns in the speech signal, and they are segment-sized units that can be pronounced independently. The standard version of Element Theory recognizes six elements, giving the phonology a level of expressiveness that is capable of capturing most contrasts, natural classes and phonological processes without overgenerating significantly. Furthermore, standard Element Theory compares favorably with two other forms of the theory, conservative and progressive. These employ different element inventories, which distinguish them from the standard theory at a superficial level. Fundamentally, however, all versions of Element Theory are united by a shared conceptual approach and a common set of assumptions and structural principles.

In 67.0\% of all clauses, the object pronoun occurred in front of the subject. Several factors that have been proposed in the literature on word order alternations were found to govern the choice between subject–object and object–subject order in the corpus under investigation. The most important findings are: (i) The Extended Animacy Hierarchy and the Semantic Role Hierarchy independently contribute to the choice of word order.

Our analysis, based on a thorough review of over two thousand Juchitán Zapotec verbs, confirms the applicability of the four-class system to Juchitán Zapotec data, improving over previous analyses of verbal morphology in the language and adding to the evidence that this system can be applied throughout the Zapotecan family (including Chatino); further, our study stresses the relevance of data-driven rather than theory-driven linguistic analyses.},

  abstract = {Language documentation faces a persistent and pervasive problem: How much material is enough to represent a language fully? How much text would we need to sample the full phoneme inventory of a language? In the phonetic/phonemic domain, what proportion of the phoneme inventory can we expect to sample in a text of a given length? Answering these questions in a quantifiable way is tricky, but asking them is necessary. The cumulative collection of Illustrative Texts published in the Illustration series in this journal over more than four decades (mostly renditions of the ‘North Wind and the Sun’) gives us an ideal dataset for pursuing these questions. Here we investigate a tractable subset of the above questions, namely: What proportion of a language’s phoneme inventory do these texts enable us to recover, in the minimal sense of having at least one allophone of each phoneme? We find that, even with this low bar, only three languages (Modern Greek, Shipibo and the Treger dialect of Breton) attest all phonemes in these texts. Unsurprisingly, these languages sit at the low end of phoneme inventory sizes (respectively 23, 24 and 36 phonemes). We then estimate the rate at which phonemes are sampled in the Illustrative Texts and extrapolate to see how much text it might take to display a language’s full inventory. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for linguistics in its quest to represent the world’s phonetic diversity, and for JIPA in its design requirements for Illustrations and in particular whether supplementary panphonic texts should be included.},

  abstract = {We show that the same Universal Grammar mechanism of Agree can have two quite different grammatical effects: normal agreement in person-number-gender features, or inducing a referential dependency between two designated DPs. As an instance of the latter, we study the switch-reference systems of two Panoan languages, Shipibo and Yawanawa. In addition to the fairly widespread distinction between same-subject (SS) and different-subject (DS) adjunct clauses, these languages also have clauses that are marked as having the object of the adjunct clause coreferential with the matrix subject (OS). We show that the coexistence of SS and OS makes it extra-clear that Agree is at work to establish a relationship between the switch-reference head and the “pivot” DP, since the relationship has all the properties characteristic of Agree: c-command, intervention, phase-restrictedness, and sensitivity to oblique case. We claim that SS and OS are the result of Agree-Link applying to create a pointer from a functional head to a DP, but Agree-Copy not applying to copy phi-features from the pointed-to DP back to the head (“Agree without agreement”)—a distinction that is independently motivated by recent studies of phi-agreement. When Agree-Copy does not apply, the pointers created by Agree-Link survive to LF, where they are interpreted as referential dependency. In contrast, DS is a default construction, used wherever SS and OS cannot be. We conclude by showing that this analysis of switch-reference extends naturally to account for the reflexive voice construction in Shipibo and other languages, illustrating the generality of the approach.},

The results suggest that the more similar the listener's dialect is to Utah English, the better his or her ability to identify Utah speakers. Moreover, it was found that listeners from Utah use less stereotypical characteristics of Utah English for identifying Utahns from non-Utahns; those from the Western United States and other locations use more. This study demonstrates that listeners with more experience with Utah English are better able to identify Utah speakers than those with less experience. These findings are also examined in light of stereotypical perceptions of both Utah English and the phonetic characteristics examined in this study.},

The proposal is that the similarities (the congruent features) that speakers perceive between the languages in contact are favored to participate in the emergence and development of a new language. Specifically, I illustrate how morphosyntactic and semantic features are more likely to be selected into the grammatical makeup of a given Creole when they preexist and are shared by some of the source languages present in its linguistic ecology. This is empirically supported in this article by numerous case studies and a survey of congruent features in twenty contact languages across nineteen grammatical and lexical domains. In order to show how congruence operates, I propose a model of matter and pattern mapping, adapted to the multilingual setting in which Creole languages emerge.*},

Cluster analysis revealed four distinct patterns of teacher–child mealtime interactions in 44 Head Start preschool classrooms: classroom discourse, home discourse, hybrid-low, and hybrid-high. Multilevel models further demonstrated a relationship among these clusters of teacher–child interactions and children's end-of-year expressive vocabulary scores controlling for ratio of teacher–child talk and pre-test scores. Children in classrooms displaying a hybrid style of mealtime discourse made the greatest gains on measures of expressive vocabulary in contrast to their peers in classrooms displaying other discourse styles.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence that pitch-movement shape can influence perceived alignment of rising (LH) pitch accents in several languages appears to challenge the well-­ established level-based approach to intonation embodied in the AM model, wherein it is typically assumed that the alignment and scaling of well-defined turning points (TPs) in the F0 contour are the primary phonetic correlates of contrastive accent category. Here we present the results of two experiments, arguing that a new ap­ proach to tonal implementation succeeds in reconciling these apparent contradictions. This approach, based on the notion of a perceptual reference point called Tonal Center of Gravity (TCoG), treats information about contour shape and TPlocalization not in ‘either-or’ terms, but rather as two sets of cues working in a fundamentally synergistic way toward a single perceptual end: the alignment and scaling of TCoG. Experiment 1 shows that TCoG-based models can perform better at distinguishing productions of English L+H* and L*+H pitch accents than comparable TP-only-based models; Experiment 2 shows that TCoG is more robust than TP-only-based models to ambiguities in TP localization commonly encountered in F0 signals from natural speech. TCoG is shown to capture key insights of movement-based approaches to intonation, without abandoning the central advantages of level-based approaches like AM.},

This language is ‘laryngeally complex’ (Silverman,~1997), exhibiting both contrastive tone and contrastive phonation. We examine the~acoustic properties of the modal and checked vowels in this language, showing that~this contrast is variably produced with several different acoustic cues. We analyze the~distribution of these cues as an instance of phonetic enhancement and further show~that the prosodic position of a given vowel determines which of several enhancement~patterns is used. We argue that extant theories of phonetic enhancement, while able to explain the patterns described here, fall short of predicting the distribution of~enhancing cues. We therefore propose that future models of phonetic enhancement~could be expanded to predict patterns in which more than one acoustic dimension is~available for phonetic enhancement.},

By using fine-grained spectrographic analysis, linguists have discovered that in many cases where neutralization was assumed, sounds are actually incompletely neutralized. That is, there are small differences in the articulation of these sounds such that they are in fact not merged, even though impressionistic descriptions report them as such. However, many researchers argue that the differences in pronunciation found in linguistic experiments are the result of hyperarticulation induced by the formality of the laboratory setting. In order to test whether or not incomplete neutralization exists in spontaneous speech, this study utilizes sociolinguistic interview data to examine coda liquid neutralization in Puerto Rican Spanish. The results from this study provide evidence that incomplete neutralization occurs outside of the laboratory context shows that the degree of neutralization and distinction between coda and in this dialect is conditioned by social and linguistic factors.},

  abstract = {It is well known that German utterance-initial lenis stops are voiceless but that German intervocalic (or intersonorant) lenis stops are sometimes produced with voicing. This variable voicing can be understood as               passive voicing               , voicing that results because of the voiced context, rather than from               active voicing               gestures by speakers. Thus, speakers are not actively aiming to voice intervocalic stops, just as they are not actively aiming to voice utterance-initial stops (Jessen \& Ringen 2002, Jessen 2004). If this is correct, the variable voicing that occurs in aspirating languages should be different from the voicing that occurs in true voice languages (such as Russian), in which speakers are actively aiming to voice both initial and intervocalic lenis stops. Since there is little data on the relative amount of intervocalic voicing in true voice languages, however, it has been difficult to evaluate this prediction. The purpose of this paper is to compare data on the voicing of intervocalic stops in German and English with data on the voicing of intervocalic stops in true voice languages. We find that the differences are substantial, supporting the claim that aspirating languages are not like true voice languages, in which the feature of contrast is [voice].},

The technique, based on statistical bootstrapping, enables the estimation of historical probability, the probability that a synchronic alternation arises based on two diachronic factors: the number of sound changes required for an alternation to arise and their respective probabilities. I estimate historical probabilities of six attested and unattested alternations targeting the feature [voice], compare historical probabilities of these alternations, perform inferential statistics on the comparison and, to evaluate the performance of the channel bias approach, compare outputs of the diachronic model against the independently observed synchronic typology. The technique also identifies mismatches between the typological predictions of the analytic bias and channel bias approaches. By comparing these mismatches with the observed typology, this paper attempts to quantitatively evaluate the distinct contributions of the two influences on typology in a set of alternations targeting the feature [voice].},

  abstract = {This paper addresses one of the most contested issues in phonology: unnatural alternations. First, non-natural phonological processes are subdivided into unmotivated and unnatural. The central topic of the paper is an unnatural process: post-nasal devoicing (PND). I collect thirteen cases of PND and argue that in all reported cases, PND does not derive from a single unnatural sound change (as claimed in some individual accounts of the data), but rather from a combination of three sound changes, each of which is phonetically motivated. I present new evidence showing that the three stages are directly historically attested in the pre-history of Yaghnobi. Based on several discussed cases, I propose a new diachronic model for explaining unnatural phenomena called the Blurring Process and point to its advantages over competing approaches (hypercorrection, perceptual enhancement, and phonetic motivation). The Blurring Process establishes general diachronic conditions for unnatural synchronic processes and can be employed to explain unnatural processes beyond PND. Additionally, I provide a proof establishing the minimal sound changes required for an unmotivated/unnatural alternation to arise. The Blurring Process and Minimal Sound Change Requirement have implications for models of typology within the Channel Bias approach. This paper thus presents a first step toward the ultimate goal of quantifying the influences of Channel Bias on phonological typology.},

  abstract = {This chapter shows that both Match and Align constraints are needed to account for an asymmetry in Japanese syntax-to-prosody mapping. In Japanese, four-word left-branching syntactic phrases undergo prosodic rebracketing, such that the first pair and second pair of words form distinct phonological phrases, while four-word right-branching syntactic phrases are matched to isomorphic phonological phrases. Match Theory is shown to be unable to explain this asymmetry, whereas Align constraints do not account for matching effects in recursive phonological phrases. Japanese is analyzed as involving the interaction of Match and Align with binarity constraints favoring phonological rebracketing. This indicates that both Match and Align are present in the universal set of syntax-prosody mapping constraints responsible for phonological phrasing.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a pattern of voicelessness dissimilation in the Kordofanian language Moro. Voiceless stops and affricates become voiced before a voiceless obstruent in a transvocalic configuration. The dissimilation is robust, and productive across morphological contexts. Phonetically, voicing in Moro is realised as a difference between prevoicing and short-lag voice onset time. This makes [voice] the most realistic featural characterisation; using another feature like [spread glottis] in lieu of [–voice] doesn't explain the contrast. Consequently, dissimilation of voicelessness in Moro is strong evidence that [voice] is a binary feature, and that […voice] may be phonologically active despite being ‘unmarked’. We show that when [–voice] is admitted, the Moro pattern is straightforwardly analysed on a par with other cases of dissimilation. Our analysis uses the theory of surface correspondence, which carries no crucial assumptions about markedness; other theories of dissimilation are considered in an online supplement.},

This analysis connects with independent facts about the the prosodic prominence of [ax] sequences in Irish phonology. I further argue that an explanatory analysis of these patterns must make use of the notion of surface optimization. Alternative frameworks that eschew surface-oriented optimization mechanisms fail to account for synchronic and diachronic properties of the Irish plural system.},

The theory is developed in more detail than ever before, and its predictions are tested and evaluated through ten in-depth analyses of diverse languages from Quechua to Kinyarwanda, together with a typological survey of over 160 dissimilation patterns drawn from over 130 languages, from Acehnese to Zulu. The book redefines the core of Surface Correspondence theory to a level of formal specificity and theoretical precision surpassing previous work. The book's findings are made more accessible by numerous examples featuring data from 47 languages from around the world"--},

Prosodic smothering arises when the prosodic status of a clitic or affix varies with the presence or absence of some outer morpheme. We first illustrate pro- sodic smothering with novel data from two genetically unrelated lan- guages, Macedonian (Slavic) and Kaqchikel (Mayan).Wethen provide a unified account of prosodic smothering based on a principled exten- sion of the theory of prosodic subcategorization (e.g., Inkelas 1990, Peperkamp 1997, Chung 2003, Yu 2003, Paster 2006, Bye 2007). Prosodic subcategorization typically involves requirements placed on items to the left or the right of the selecting morpheme. We show that prosodic smothering naturally emerges in a theory that also allows for subcategorization in the vertical dimension, such that morphemes may select for the prosodic category that immediately dominates them in surface prosodic structure. This extension successfully reduces two apparent cases of nonlocal prosodic conditioning to the effects of strictly local prosodic selection.},

Specific topics discussed in detail include the identification of prosodic domains, the universality of prosodic categories, the recent resurgence of interest in the role of recursion in prosodic structure, crosslinguistic variation in syntax–prosody mapping, prosodic influences on syntax and word order, and the influence of sentence processing in the planning and shaping of prosodic domains.

  abstract = {Uspanteko (Mayan) is unique among the languages of Guatemala in having a full-fledged system of lexical tone. Tone is thoroughly integrated into the morphology of the language, and triggers several predictable phonological alternations. The Uspanteko tone system is also relatively simple, involving at most two contrastive categories. However, tone in Uspanteko shows a high degree of phonetic variability, and there is no consensus as to what tones are phonetically or phonologically active in the language. This paper argues that at least some of this unclarity owes to the effect of intonation, which can obscure lexical tone on vowels. A phonetic study attempting to control for intonation suggests that lexical tone in Uspanteko involves a privative [H]\textasciitilde Ø contrast on short vowels, and either a [H]\textasciitilde Ø or [H]\textasciitilde [L] contrast on long vowels. The relationship between the phonetics of tone and its low functional load in Uspanteko is also discussed},

The bulk of the paper is dedicated to a case study of Huariapano, a language that has been claimed to motivate multiple, coexisting but autonomous, layers of metrical parsing. I show that this conclusion is premature: both stress and segmental patterning in Huariapano can be modelled within a single system of constituency, once context-dependent variation in foot form is taken into account. The reanalysis developed here also draws on the idea that foot-initial syllables may be targeted by augmentation or fortition processes even when unstressed. Independent evidence for foot-initial strengthening is furnished by segmental phonotactics in a range of other languages.},

For Norwegian object shift (OS), it has been shown that while pronominal objects with non-nominal antecedents generally do not shift, this is not the case when these elements take on the discourse function of continuing topics. In this paper, we show that a very similar pattern can be observed in German. However, this is not related to whether object pronouns scramble or not, but rather to which pronominal form is used to refer back to the clausal antecedent. In German, das is generally used to refer back to non-nominal antecedents, however, es is also sometimes an option. In this study, we find parallels between the use of OS and es, on the one hand, and lack of OS and das, on the other, and propose that the former is preferred when the proposition the proform refers back to is part of the common ground in the discourse. This ties in nicely with previous research on Norwegian OS, as in order for a proposition to constitute a continuing topic in the discourse, it has to be established as part of the interlocutors’ common ground.},

We evaluate our results against three recent strands of accounts of OS, namely a prosodic/phonological account, an account in terms of cognitive status, and an account in terms of information structure. Our investigation shows that there is both within-language and across-language variation in the application of OS, and that the three accounts can explain some of our data. However, all accounts are faced with challenges, especially when explaining exceptional cases.},

  abstract = {This study examines the role of distance in the decision among grammatical variants. The empirical test case is the English mandative subjunctive construction, which co-occurs with an embedded modal auxiliary, a subjunctive or an indicative verb form. The fact that the subjunctive is triggered by specific lexical items allows one to measure the distance between the triggering unit and the target verb. This distance is found to play a significant role in the grammatical decision process. With increasing distance between trigger and target, the probability of selecting a modal auxiliary increases and the probability of selecting the subjunctive decreases. The theoretical account hinges on the range and strength of linguistic units. Syntactic units (i.e. modals) are claimed to have a wider range than morphological units (i.e. indicative and subjunctive). Furthermore, the indicative is claimed to have a wider range than the subjunctive. Varying ranges are interpreted as varying decay rates. The lower decay rate of syntactic as compared to morphological units results from the syntactic level being superordinated to the morphological level in language production. The inclusion of the semantic and the phonological levels confirms that the position of a level in the structural hierarchy determines its range.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The choice of theme vowels in Spanish nouns and adjectives can be predicted neither from the phonological shape of roots nor from syntactic features like gender. However, this state of affairs does not require the postulation of inflectional class features. The alternative is for the Spanish lexicon to store stems with their theme vowels, instead of roots annotated with declension diacritics; default generalizations over the lexical entries of stems can be expressed by means of lexical redundancy rules. The hypothesis of stem storage is compatible with the failure of Spanish theme vowels to surface in certain environments: this is demonstrably caused by an entirely general and regular phonological process deleting unaccented stem-final vowels before suffixes beginning with another vowel. Stem storage receives further support from psycholinguistic data from recognition latencies. Additional new evidence comes from cyclic locality conditions on allomorph selection, as shown by an analysis of the well-known stress-driven alternation displayed by items like [k               o               nt-á-ɾ] ‘count.               inf               ’\,∼\,[k               wé               nt-a] ‘count. 3               sg               ’.

The locality problem vanishes if /koNt-a/ and /kweNt-a/ are both listed in the lexicon as stem allomorphs. These data show that Stratal Optimality Theory allied to a stem-driven theory of morphology performs better than alternative approaches to allomorphic locality. Root-driven Distributed Morphology is too local: the domains for allomorph selection that it generates are too narrow. Conversely, noncyclic versions of Optimality Theory fail to predict allomorphic locality (even if they can describe its effects) because they endow allomorph selection with unrestricted access to the global environment.},

Dr Bhat argues that these words do not form a single category, but rather two different categories called 'personal pronouns' and 'proforms'. He points out several differences between the two, such as the occurrence of a dual structure among proforms but not among personal pronouns. These differences are shown to derive from the distinct functions that the two categories have to perform in language.   The book also shows that the so-called interrogative pronouns of familiar languages are less concerned with interrogation than with indefiniteness. The author shows that the notion of indefiniteness that can be associated with these and other pronouns is quite different from the one that can be associated with noun phrases. He goes on to postulate certain typological distinctions such as 'two-person' and 'three-person' languages and 'free-pronoun' and 'bound-pronoun' languages.},

The first, canonically exemplified by Japanese -ka, occurs in all interrogatives, in matrix as well as embedded contexts. The second, the object of the present study, is exemplified by the Hindi-Urdu particle kya:. Polar kya: occurs in polar questions but not in wh questions, and it occurs optionally in matrix questions but only in a restricted way in embedded questions. We analyze this particle as presupposing that its prejacent denotes a singleton propositional set and as partitioning the questioned proposition into two parts that can be characterized as at-issue and not at-issue. These two aspects of its meaning are shown to capture several facets of the behavior of the polar question particle kya: that have not previously been analyzed or even systematically described. The paper also touches upon well-known phenomena, such as interrogative selection and alternative questions, but from a new perspective and opens up a way of looking at interrogative particles in other languages that do not seem to neatly fit the mold of regular question particles.},

This preservation of contrast is shown to be an instance of patterned exceptionality. Rather than being a result of syllable structure or the typical lowering pattern of high to mid vowels in Chamorro, this exceptionality is instead conditioned by perceptual factors. The phonetic context provided by intervocalic laryngeals provides external cues pertaining to the quality of the preceding vowel, enabling the preservation of underlying contrast. This paper will demonstrate that laryngeals allow more robust acoustic information for perceiving vowel height (F1) when compared to supralaryngeal consonants. The continuation of vocalic F1 into and through the laryngeal provides more cues to the preceding vowel’s quality, allowing an underlying mid-high contrast to surface faithfully in this “exceptional” environment. This supports theories that integrate phonetic information into the synchronic phonology. The licensing of contrast provided by intervocalic laryngeals carries with it both typological and experimental predictions regarding the patterning of laryngeal consonants and the perceptual environment they provide.},

Our core revision to earlier UA approaches is a distinction between checking and valuation: while we maintain that checking is strictly regulated by UA, we propose that valuation depends on a secondary relation of accessibility, which allows valuation of a higher probe by a lower, accessible goal, in cases where the checker of the probe cannot (fully) value it. This model provides a better account of asymmetries between Spec-head agreement and long-distance agreement patterns, and also accounts for movement-agreement interactions without a need for EPP features.}

Mazatec, on the other hand, employs breathy and laryngealized vowels as separate phonemes that contrast with modal vowels. Several acoustic measures show that the difference between nonmodal and modal vowels is stronger and lasts longer in Mazatec than in Tagalog. Contrary to expectations, cross-speaker variation is not greater in Tagalog.},

Previous analyses that derive the construction via syntactic movement, including those attributing verb doubling to the formation of parallel chains (e.g., Aboh 2006; Kandybowicz 2008), are incompatible with remnant movement (Müller 1998), which does not give rise to doubling. This article presents data from the predicate fronting construction in Yiddish, in which verbs always double but complements never do. I argue that these seemingly contradictory pronunciation facts can be reconciled even if one assumes that phrasal movement and head movement are both syntactic. More specifically, the pronunciation of occurrences in Yiddish (doubled or not) follows from the general conditions on Spell-Out (or Transfer                                pf                              ) defined by Collins and Stabler (2016), modified only to accommodate syntactic head movement. Post-syntactic PF repairs are thus not required to account for the facts of the Yiddish predicate fronting construction. If such repairs are needed to generate doubling phenomena in other languages, they should be explicitly defined so as to modify or override the predictions of default Spell-Out conditions.},

  abstract = {Final obstruent devoicing is common in the world’s languages and constitutes a clear case of parallel phonological evolution. Final obstruent voicing, in contrast, is claimed to be rare or nonexistent. Two distinct theoretical approaches crystalize around obstruent voicing patterns. Traditional markedness accounts view these sound patterns as consequences of universal markedness constraints prohibiting voicing, or favoring voicelessness, in final position, and predict that final obstruent voicing does not exist. In contrast, phonetic-historical accounts explain skewed patterns of voicing in terms of common phonetically based devoicing tendencies, allowing for rare cases of final obstruent voicing under special conditions. In this article, phonetic and phonological evidence is offered for final obstruent voicing in Lakota, an indigenous Siouan language of the Great Plains of North America. In Lakota, oral stops /p/, /t/, and /k/ are regularly pronounced as [b], [l], and [ɡ] in word- and syllable-final position when phrase-final devoicing and preobstruent devoicing do not occur.*},

  abstract = {Miri, an Austronesian language spoken in northern Sarawak, Malaysia, has two sets of vowel changes that are conditioned by voiced obstruents. In the first set, a last-syllable low vowel is fronted and raised to [e], or less commonly [i], if a voiced obstruent appears earlier in the word, while a penultimate low vowel immediately following the trigger is skipped. In the second, a high vowel in the final syllable undergoes breaking (diphthongisation) or lowering, depending upon specific conditions, unless there is a voiced obstruent anywhere earlier in the word. For both triggers and suppressors, this effect is cancelled by an intervening blocking consonant, which includes any nasal or voiceless obstruent except glottal stop. The challenge is to understand why voiced obstruents have this double function, acting as a trigger with low vowels and a suppressor with high vowels, given the lack of an a priori transparent relationship between low vowel fronting and high vowel breaking/lowering.},

In the original presentation of case theory in Chomsky (1980), abstract Case is related to the morphological property case via the hypothesis that the formal features that regulate the syntactic distribution of NPs are the same features that are overtly realised as case morphology in some languages. This article explores case theory in government-binding, case filter, the notion of government, the transition from government-binding to minimalism, and topics in case theory within government-binding/minimalism such as null case, ergativity, and case typology.},

Distributing the functions of the classical morpheme in this way allows for analysis of mismatches between the minimal units of grammatical combination and the minimal units of sound. Much work within the framework is nevertheless guided by seeking to understand restrictions on such mismatches, balancing the need for the detailed description of complex morphological data in individual languages against an attempt to explain broad patterns in terms of restrictions imposed by grammatical principles.},

If learners optimise their perception by gradually ranking their cue constraints, and reuse the resulting ranking in production, they automatically introduce a prototype effect, which can be counteracted by an articulatory effect. If the two effects are of unequal size, the learner will end up with a sound system auditorily different from that of her language environment. Computer simulations of sibilant inventories show that, independently of the initial auditory sound system, a stable equilibrium is reached within a small number of generations. In this stable state, the dispersion of the sibilants of the language strikes an optimal balance between articulatory ease and auditory contrast. Crucially, these results are derived within a model without any goal-oriented elements such as dispersion constraints.},

  abstract = {Phonologically conditioned allomorphy is sometimes determined by universal marking conditions derived from low-ranked constraints, which is viewed as an effect of the emergence of the unmarked (TETU) in optimality theory. In this paper we present two case studies that make crucial use of allomorph selection as TETU but also of an additional property of the lexical representation of allomorphs, namely lexical ordering of allomorphs. The first case is the puzzling selection of definite marker in Haitian Creole (analyzed as an instance of anti-markedness in previous OT works), which yields to an appropriate analysis in terms of allomorph ordering. In the second case study, gender allomorph selection in Catalan, we propose a constraint Respect that ensures compliance with idiosyncratic lexical specifications, which further interacts with allomorph selection. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper examines two related phenomena from Catalan that pose a challenge to a proposal in McCarthy (2012) that combines Harmonic Serialism (HS) with the theory of Optimal Interleaving (OI) of Wolf (2009). The first phenomenon, found with stems ending in a sibilant, is the selection of a marked masculine allomorph only before the plural morph, also a sibilant, which prevents an OCP violation. The second, phrasal, phenomenon is restricted to one dialect of Catalan: the plural morpheme is not realised in prenominal position only when it would surface between two consonants. It is shown that, with some crucial modifications on the way spell-out proceeds, HS/OI can account for the two phenomena when they occur separately, but when they co-occur within the same phrase, wrong predictions are made, due to the one-change-at-a-time basic property of HS. These problems do not arise in a parallel OT approach.},

Phrasal phonological domains can instead be defined directly in the syntax. In this response, we argue that Modular PIC does not provide a convincing new approach to the syntax-phonology interface, as it is both too powerful and too restrictive. We show that the analysis offered of raddoppiamento fonosintattico in Eastern Abruzzese does not justify the loss of restrictiveness Modular PIC brings to phase theory. We also show that Modular PIC is too restrictive to account for phenomena, from Bantu languages and others, that have received satisfactory analyses within interface theories that appeal to prosodic constituents. We conclude that Modular PIC does not successfully replace prosodic constituent approaches to the interface.},

In this article, which analyzes opaque forms in Italian, Spanish, and, especially, Catalan, it is proposed that pronominal clitics constitute hierarchical structures of monovalent morphological features. This hierarchy reflects markedness relations. Most opaque forms are obtained through morphological rules that delink or insert morphological features, thus rendering the target structure identical to the structure of another clitic. Morphological rules take place within the Morphology Component, between S-structure and PF (cf. Halle 1990, 1991). Phonological information, not present in the syntax, is introduced by spell-out rules very late in the Morphology Component and provides the input to PF. Clitic order is determined through mapping to a template. Some other opaque forms arise at that point.},

  abstract = {This article discusses a phenomenon which has been referred to as ‘double determination’, ‘double definiteness’, or in the Scandinavian tradition ‘over-definiteness’. In this article, I define double determination and double definiteness, so that a distinction is made between the two terms. I use ‘double determination’ when both elements can function independently as semantic determiners. ‘Double definiteness’, on the other hand, is a form of agreement. A number of Swedish constructions are then examined which are plausible candidates for double determination. It is shown that only some of these are genuine cases of double determination, the others are more accurately described as double definiteness. In the cases of double determination, the determination is represented once as a syntactic element and once as a morphological element. The second part of this article focuses on this ‘morphological determiner’, referred to as def. The Swedish morphological determiner is compared with those of the other Scandinavian languages and the languages of the Balkans. It is shown that in languages which have an element like the Swedish def there is considerable variation in how this element functions within the language and in its status with respect to double determination and double definiteness.},

  abstract = {Welsh, like the other Celtic languages, is best-known amongst linguists for its verb-initial word order and use of initial consonantal mutations. However it has many more characteristics which are of interest to syntacticians. This book provides a concise, yet comprehensive and accessible overview of the major syntactic phenomena of Welsh. The authors cover a broad variety of topics, including finite and infinitival clauses, noun phrases, agreement and tense, word order, clause structure, dialect variation, and the historical back- ground of the language. Contemporary colloquial Welsh serves as the main source of data and, where appropriate, is complemented by data from con- temporary literary forms of the language. Data from Middle and Early Modern Welsh are also discussed. In each chapter, the authors first present a theory-neutral description of the data and then go on to examine theoretical analyses within Principles \& Parameters theory and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. The results shed new light not only on the syntax of Welsh but also on the merits of the respective theoretical frameworks. An engaging guide to everything that is interesting about Welsh syntax, this book will be welcomed by theoretical syntacticians, typologists, historical linguists and Celticists alike.},

  abstract = {Economy considerations have always played an important role in the generative theory of grammar. They are particularly prominent in the most recent instantiation of this approach, the Minimalist Program, which explores the possibility that Universal Grammar is an optimal way of satisfying requirements that are imposed on the language faculty by the external systems that interface with the language faculty which is also characterized by optimal, computationally efficient design. In this respect, the operations of the computational system that produce linguistic expressions must be optimal in that they must satisfy general considerations of simplicity and efficient design. Simply put, the guiding principles here are (a) do something only if you need to and (b) if you do need to, do it in the most economical/efficient way. These considerations ban superfluous steps in derivations and superfluous symbols in representations. Under economy guidelines, movement takes place only when there is a need for it (with both syntactic and semantic considerations playing a role here), and when it does take place, it takes place in the most economical way: it is as short as possible and carries as little material as possible. Furthermore, economy is evaluated locally, on the basis of immediately available structure. The locality of syntactic dependencies is also enforced by minimal search and by limiting the number of syntactic objects and the amount of structure accessible in the derivation. This is achieved by transferring parts of syntactic structure to the interfaces during the derivation, the transferred parts not being accessible for further syntactic operations.},

As in the early approach, there is no feature checking in intermediate positions of successive-cyclic movement. However, as in the current approach and unlike in early minimalism, successive-cyclic movement starts before the final target of movement enters the structure, and Form Chain is eliminated. The locality of Move and the locality of Agree are shown to be radically different, Agree being free from several mechanisms that constrain Move, namely, phases and the Activation Condition. However, there is no need to take phases to define locality domains of syntax or to posit the Activation Condition as an independent principle. They still hold empirically for Move as theorems. The Generalized EPP (the “I need a Spec” property of attracting heads) and the Inverse Case Filter are also dispensable. The traditional Case Filter, stated as a checking requirement, is the sole driving force of A-movement. More generally, Move is always driven by a formal inadequacy (an uninterpretable feature) of the moving element, while Agree is target driven. The system resolves a lookahead problem that arises under the EPP-driven movement approach, where the EPP diacritic indicating that X moves is placed on Y, not X, although X often needs to start moving before Y enters the structure.},

In the current study, we examined whether the same holds true for the frequency of specific language activities at home. In a group of five- and six-year-old Frisian–Dutch bilingual children (n = 120), we investigated to what extent vocabulary and morphology knowledge were predicted by reading activities, watching TV, and story-telling activities in both languages. The results showed that reading in Frisian predicted both Frisian vocabulary and morphology, while reading in Dutch only predicted Dutch vocabulary. This shows that reading at home is most important for the development of the minority language. This especially holds true for the acquisition of Frisian morphology, a domain that is known to be vulnerable in language acquisition.},

  abstract = {This work is a comprehensive description of the grammar of Sierra Popoluca, a Mixe-Zoquean language spoken by approximately 28,000 people in Veracruz, Mexico. This detailed description and analysis includes an overview of the language and its family, its typological features and its phonology. The grammar also provides an overview of the word classes, including verbs, nouns, relational nouns/postpositions, adjectives, adverbs, numbers, and formative types. The bulk of this grammar is devoted to the morphosyntax of Sierra Popoluca, including nouns and nominal morphology, verbs and verbal morphology, and the mechanisms for expressing tense, aspect, mood, and modality. An agglutinating, polysynthetic, head-marking language with ergative-absolutive alignment and sensitivity to animacy and saliency hierarchies, Sierra Popoluca has a number of strategies to form complex predicates, which include verb serialization, noun incorporation, and dependent verb constructions. These complex predicate formation strategies and sentence-level syntax are also described here. A compilation of interlinearized texts appears in the appendix. There is no competing work that provides the breadth and depth of coverage of the Sierra Popoluca grammar.},

Instances of words containing from the running speech of a Utahn who variably exhibits the merger were rated by a panel of speakers on whether they were produced as or , allowing utterances to be classified as merged (into ), unmerged, or intermediate. Merged and unmerged instances were not found to be separated cleanly when taking just F1 and F2 into consideration, but looking at F1, F2, and F3 simultaneously resulted in a clean split between those categories, with the intermediate cases falling along the border between them. Further, the formant values did not match up with any simple articulatory explanation for the merger and its attendant distinction. Not only does this demonstrate that Utah's card-cord merger is the result of the simultaneous manipulation of multiple articulatory features, it raises the possibility that clear separation between phonetic categories could be found in other cases that might generally be expected to have some overlap.},

An interesting effect is found: direct objects may not have prenominal demonstratives in transitive constructions, but may have prenominal demonstratives in a number of ditransitive constructions. I argue that this alternation is tied to Case. It is shown that these alternations can be accounted for using a theory of dependent Case in which Case has a licensing function. In Kikuyu, direct objects and subjects are too distant in the structure for the former to be assigned Case, and therefore the N head of the direct object must be adjacent to the verbal complex at the surface in order to be licensed (Levin 2015). However, the presence of a medial argument allows direct objects to be assigned Case since the two are sufficiently local, thus obviating the requirement for N-V adjacency.},

  abstract = {This article deals mainly with the distribution and function of the infinitival marker in Standard German and in Alemannic, a dialect spoken in Southern Germany.* At first sight both form and distribution differ in these two variants to a great extent. The most important difference is that Alemannic generally lacks the infinitival marker               zu               (               to               in English,               te               in Dutch) in the environments where it occurs in SG. Instead, bare infinitives are used to a much greater extent than in SG.                                         A detailed comparison shows how these Alemannic data can shed some new light on SG infinitival constructions — which are notoriously hard to analyze, especially the use of               zu               . It will turn out that               zu               plays hardly any syntactic role in restructuring contexts and is thus best accounted for in the word formation component rather than in the syntax. Another important issue to be discussed is extraposition. As will be shown below, extraposition is a much more widely used option in Alemannic than in SG — nevertheless, the Alemannic constructions show mono-clausal, i.e. coherent properties. I will argue that extraposition should not be taken as an indication for a bi-clausal structure — as it is done traditionally — but rather that the preferred intraposed order in SG should be analyzed in terms of a PF “flip-operation”. The attested variation between SG and Alemannic will thus turn out to be merely variation on the surface. But there are constructions where both variants differ more profoundly, namely in the context of propositional verbs. These differences will be traced back to the existence of a second kind of               zu               — existing only in SG — that can indeed license a full CP.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the meaning and use of clefted wh-interrogatives (I-clefts) in Swedish. It is shown that I-clefts always relate immediately to the topic under discussion and serve to clarify a matter in relation to this topic. They are never used in out-of-the-blue contexts. I argue that I-clefts have the same information structure as typically assumed for declarative clefts: the clefted clause expresses an existential presupposition and the cleft phrase is the identificational focus of the utterance. I further argue that the implication of existence commonly associated with canonical argument questions is weaker (a conversational implicature) than the existential presupposition associated with clefts. The results from an extensive corpus survey show that argument I-clefts (who, what) constitute no less than 98\% of the total number of I-clefts in my material. This frequency is linked to the presuppositional status of the cleft construction: in contexts where the denoted event is presupposed as part of the common ground, the clefted variety is the more effective choice, due to its clear partitioning of focus and ground. The ‘cost’ of using a more complex syntactic structure (the cleft) is thus counterbalanced by the benefit of being able to pose a question adjusted to the contextual requirements. As non-argument questions are typically presuppositional irrespective of syntactic form, the gain of using a cleft is less obvious – hence their infrequency in the material.},

  abstract = {Understanding a linguistic theory within OT requires an exact characterization of the ranking conditions necessitated by data. These conditions determine the formal shape of the grammar while providing the crucial link between the data and its interpretation. We introduce an algorithm (‘Fusional Reduction’, FRed) which calculates the necessary and sufficient ranking conditions inherent in any collection of candidates and presents them in a maximally concise and informative way. The algorithm, stemming from the original proposal of Brasoveanu 2003, is set within the fusional ERC theory of Prince 2002a. In this context, the Most Informative Basis and the Skeletal Basis emerge as the two important types of reduced representations of ranking structure. We examine their properties and show how FRed produces them from data. Fine-grained FRed is compared with broad-stroke RCD (Tesar and Smolensky 1993, Tesar 1995et seq.), and RCD is reinterpreted and embraced within FRed as a simplified, information-losing sub-case. Finally, FRed is compared with other related algorithms in structure, worst-case complexity, and relevance to the analytical enterprise. This paper revises Brasoveanu and Prince 2005, 2007; Prince and Brasoveanu 2010 gives a more formal perspective, with proof of the theorems.},

In flapping, /d/ and /t/ both become a voiced flap in certain prosodic contexts (see, e.g., Kahn 1980). A number of studies show that this neutralization is incomplete: /d/-flaps can be distinguished from /t/-flaps on the surface (Fox and Terbeek 1977). Other studies, however, have found conflicting results (Port 1976). This study finds that flapping is an incompletely neutralizing process‚Äî/d/-flaps and /t/-flaps can be distinguished on the surface by the duration of the preceding vowel, at least for some speakers. Additionally, some studies find evidence that hyperarticulation and orthography have an effect on whether neutralization is complete or incomplete (Fourakis and Iverson 1984, Warner et al. 2006). The present study employed two tasks: a minimal pair reading task, designed to increase these potential effects, and a morphological paradigm completion/"wug" task, designed to reduce these effects. No significant differences between the two tasks were found, thus failing to support the claim that incomplete neutralization is due to these extragrammatical factors.},

Following Mori (2002), Experiment I shows that the vowels of monomoraic nouns in Japanese are lengthened when they appear in isolation within a Prosodic Word, in order to satisfy a bimoraic minimality requirement (Poser, 1990). However, going beyond the scope of Mori’s (2002) study, Experiment I also shows that the lengthened nouns’ vowels are not as long as underlyingly long vowels. These results expand the typology of incomplete neutralization by showing that incomplete neutralization happens for duration-based length contrasts. Experiment II examines another lengthening phenomenon in response to the Japanese bimoraicity requirement, originally described in telephone number recitation (Itoˆ, 1990), and found that this lengthening is completely neutralizing—lengthened vowels become at least as long as underlyingly long vowels. Taken together, the current project shows that the same language can possess two related phonological patterns, only one of which is incompletely neutralizing.},

  abstract = {Incomplete neutralisation presents a problem for classical modular feed-forward grammars: it results in surface phonetic distinctions between phonologically neutralised segments. This paper argues for a model of incomplete neutralisation using two independently motivated theoretical devices: paradigm uniformity and weighted phonetic constraints. A case study is presented, showing that Japanese monomoraic lengthening results in incomplete neutralisation: when monomoraic nouns with short vowels are lengthened to fill a bimoraic minimality requirement, they reach a duration intermediate between that of unlengthened short vowels and underlyingly long vowels. The Japanese case has properties distinct from other classically cited examples of incomplete neutralisation such as final devoicing, which are not predicted by previous theories of neutralisation. The Weighted Paradigm Uniformity theory of incomplete neutralisation is shown to make four unique predictions, and is argued to better capture the typology of incomplete neutralisation.},

In this study, we test phonological constraints not just in particular cases, but across the board. We employ a novel method that statistically models the distribution of word bigrams (consecutive two-word sequences) and how this distribution is influenced by phonological constraints. Our study of multiple corpora indicates that several phonological constraints do indeed play a statistically significant role in English sentence formation. We also show that by examining particular subsets of the corpora we can diagnose the mechanisms whereby phonologically marked sequences come to be underrepresented. We conclude by discussing modes of grammatical organization compatible with our findings.*},

The evidence comes from a High tone spreading process attested in Copperbelt Bemba (CB), which as reported by Bickmore and Kula (2013) et seq., occurs over a ternary domain. In quintessentially metrical fashion, the domain is sensitive to the presence and position of heavy syllables. Thus, we argue that metrical theory should take the CB data into account.},

This exemplary grammar of Yucatec Maya includes examples and careful explanations of the phonological, morphological, and syntactic structures of the language. Bricker's research is distinguished in its treatment of seemingly aberrant spellings of Maya words as clues to the way they were actually pronounced at different times in the past. Her chapters include topics seldom covered, such as deictic particles, affects, and reduplication. Of special interest is a poetic form of reduplication composed of couplets (or triplets) found in documents from each of the centuries, indicating the continuity of this genre from the Colonial to the Modern version of this language"--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Background:Modern Match-theoretic approaches to prosodic structure derive cross-linguisticvariation in prosody from two sources: (i) variation in syntactic structure and (ii) variation in theranking of a set of universal markedness constraints on syntax-prosody mappings. In this study,we hold (i) constant in order to examine (ii) more closely. We show with novel fieldwork datathat Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (SLZ) fills a problematic gap in the prosody of VSO languages.VSO languages differ in the prosodic phrasing of transitive sentences with full DP arguments(1). In Irish (Celtic: Elfner 2012; Bennett, Elfner, \& McCloskey 2016), (1a) is observed for complexsubjects and (1b) possible for single-word subjects. Otomi (Oto-Manguean: Palancar 2004) shows(1b), and Ch’ol (Mayan: Clemens \& Coon 2018, Clemens 2019) shows (1c).(1)a. V [SO]    b. [VS] O    c. [V] [S] [O]A language with only (1a) would be generated if Match outranks certain markedness constraints.According to Kalivoda (2018), no such language has been attested: a challenge to Match theory.We show here that SLZ fills this gap.Language \& Methodology:SLZ is an endangered Oto-Manguean (Northern Zapotec) languagespoken in Santiago Laxopa, Ixtlán, Oaxaca, Mexico. It features VSO structure and lexical tone.Data presented here comes from weekly virtual elicitation with one native speaker consultantduring the COVID-19 pandemic.Phenomenon:In languages with downstep, particular tone values trigger lowering for subse-quent tones within a prosodic domain (Connell 2011). Patterns of downstep can thus be used asa diagnostic for prosodic structure (e.g. Xitsonga: Selkirk 2009, 2011). We observe in SLZ that aH-tone causes downstep of all subsequent H-tones only within certain domains, which we taketo be non-maximal phonological phrases (φnonmax) (Ito \& Mester 2012). The right edge of theseφnonmaxare associated with pitch resets.Prosodic structure:Using downstep as our diagnostic for the placement of φnonmax, we proposethat transitive sentences in SLZ with full DPs are phrased as in (2a)—e.g.Bgò békù’nh↓békù’nh,‘The dog fed the dog.’ An alternative phrasing (2b) is only possible with dependent pronominalsubjects—e.g.Bkàtch=é’ békù’nh, ‘She (an elder) hid the dog.’(2)a.[ι[φmaxVω[φSω↓Oω]φ]φmax]ιb.[ι[φmax(VωScl)ω[φOω]φ]φmax]ιH-tones in a subject trigger downstep in an object, regardless of the amount of phonological ma-terial intervening, suggesting the arguments are phrased together. A lack of downstep betweenH-tones in the verb and the subject shows the verb lies outside this φ. Weak subjects (clitics),however, must adjoin to the verb (2b): subject clitics with H-tone fail to trigger downstep in ob-jects. Finally, crucial evidence for recursion comes from the fact that downstep is not observedfor H-tones within the verb; we conclude the verb adjoins without its own φ.Analysis:As noted by Clemens \& Coon (2018), existing syntactic accounts of VSO structure arenot distinct for purposes of syntax-prosody mapping, all yielding the simplified schema in (3).(3)[CP[TPV[XPSDPODP]XP]TP]CPTo capture the typology of VSO prosodies, we assume the existence of the constraints Match(XP,φ),StRongStaRt(XP), EalSisteRs, and BinaRity, as defined in Bennett et al. (2016). SLZ phras-ing is predicted when Match dominates ES and Bin, with the behavior of clitic subjects derivedfrom undominated StRongStaRt. Other rankings of these four constraints produce the attestedpatterns of Irish, Otomi, and Ch’ol. SLZ thus validates the typology predicted by Match theory,defending its validity as a theory of the syntax-prosody interface},

Even though movement often is considered a syntactic phenomenon, some cases seem best analyzed prosodically, such as pronoun post-posing in Irish (Bennett, Elfner, \& McClosky 2016). We explore prosodically driven movement in Norwegian, which is known for having pronominal object shift (OS). We show that OS can be explained by Match Theory (Selkirk 2009, 2011), but only if the MATCH constraints are sensitive to lexical items and their projects instead of Elfner's (2012) definition where Match is sensitive to lexical and functional elements and their projections (see also Ito \& Mester 2019).},

This study addresses three of the points that Hannahs \& Tallerman raised which I am calling the grammar problem, the homophony problem, and the allomorph interaction. I show that Lexical Selection is uniquely adapted to account for each of the points concerning the definite article allomorphy. Additionally, this study proposes that Lexical Selection needs to be amended with multiple Priority constraints that are morpheme specific. It also appears that there appears to exist a unique relationship between the constraint rankings of these multiple Priority constraints in what is called the prioritization of the hierarchy.},

The analysis further argues for an expansion of prosodic subcategorization to include allomorph-specific subcategorization frames in light of the Welsh definite article. Additionally, this thesis makes the argument against a purely morphological subcategorization approach to phonologically conditioned allomorphy, contrary to the claims of Paster (2009, 2015).},

This reflects the theoretical claim originating from the 1980’s that we are dealing with two different syntactic rules. It has become increasingly clear, however, that the notion of scrambling is used as an umbrella term for different kinds of movement. This review will show that there are good reasons for assuming that object shift and one specific kind of scrambling can be characterized as A-movement of the object(s) triggered by structural case features. This motivates a revaluation of the data that led to the earlier conclusion that object shift and scrambling behave differently with respect to Holmberg’s generalization, as well as a discussion of the linguistic nature of this generalization.},

Chapter 1 discusses the syntactic and semantic properties of coordinate structures and their constituting elements, that is, the coordinators and the coordinands they link. Chapter 2 discusses the types of ellipsis known as conjunction reduction and gapping found in coordinate structures. Chapter 3 discusses elements seemingly exhibiting coordination-like properties, such as dan ‘than’ in comparative constructions like Jan is groter dan zij ‘Jan is taller than she’.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The world is facing a crisis of language loss that rivals, or exceeds, the rate of loss of biodiversity. There is an increasing urgency to understand the drivers of language change in order to try and stem the catastrophic rate of language loss globally and to improve language vitality. Here we present a unique case study of language shift in an endangered Indigenous language, with a dataset of unprecedented scale. We employ a novel multidimensional analysis, which allows the strength of a quantitative approach without sacrificing the detail of individual speakers and specific language variables, to identify social, cultural, and demographic factors that influence language shift in this community. We develop the concept of the ‘linguatype’, a sample of an individual’s language variants, analogous to the geneticists’ concept of ‘genotype’ as a sample of an individual’s genetic variants. We use multidimensional clustering to show that while family and household have significant effects on language patterns, peer group is the most significant factor for predicting language variation. Generalized linear models demonstrate that the strongest factor promoting individual use of the Indigenous language is living with members of the older generation who speak the heritage language fluently. Wright–Fisher analysis indicates that production of heritage language is lost at a significantly faster rate than perception, but there is no significant difference in rate of loss of verbs vs nouns, or lexicon vs grammar. Notably, we show that formal education has a negative relationship with Indigenous language retention in this community, with decreased use of the Indigenous language significantly associated with more years of monolingual schooling in English. These results suggest practical strategies for strengthening Indigenous language retention and demonstrate a new analytical approach to identifying risk factors for language loss in Indigenous communities that may be applicable to many languages globally.},

  abstract = {We have argued that dynamically defined articulatory gestures are the appropriate units to serve as the atoms of phonological representation. Gestures are a natural unit, not only because they involve task-oriented movements of the articulators, but because they arguably emerge as prelinguistic discrete units of action in infants. The use of gestures, rather than constellations of gestures as in Root nodes, as basic units of description makes it possible to characterise a variety of language patterns in which gestural organisation varies. Such patterns range from the misorderings of disordered speech through phonological rules involving gestural overlap and deletion to historical changes in which the overlap of gestures provides a crucial explanatory element.Gestures can participate in language patterns involving overlap because they are spatiotemporal in nature and therefore have internal duration. In addition, gestures differ from current theories of feature geometry by including the constriction degree as an inherent part of the gesture. Since the gestural constrictions occur in the vocal tract, which can be charactensed in terms of tube geometry, all the levels of the vocal tract will be constricted, leading to a constriction degree hierarchy. The values of the constriction degree at each higher level node in the hierarchy can be predicted on the basis of the percolation principles and tube geometry. In this way, the use of gestures as atoms can be reconciled with the use of Constriction degree at various levels in the vocal tract (or feature geometry) hierarchy.The phonological notation developed for the gestural approach might usefully be incorporated, in whole or in part, into other phonologies. Five components of the notation were discussed, all derived from the basic premise that gestures are the primitive phonological unit, organised into gestural scores. These components include (1) constriction degree as a subordinate of the articulator node and (2) stiffness (duration) as a subordinate of the articulator node. That is, both CD and duration are inherent to the gesture. The gestures are arranged in gestural scores using (3) articulatory tiers, with (4) the relevant geometry (articulatory, tube or feature) indicated to the left of the score and (5) structural information above the score, if desired. Association lines can also be used to indicate how the gestures are combined into phonological units. Thus, gestures can serve both as characterisations of articulatory movement data and as the atoms of phonological representation.},

In articulatory phonology, the basic units of phonological contrast are               gestures               , which are also abstract characterizations of articulatory events, each with an intrinsic time or duration. Utterances are modeled as organized patterns (               constellations               ) of gestures, in which gestural units may overlap in time. The phonological structures defined in this way provide a set of articulatorily based natural classes. Moreover, the patterns of overlapping organization can be used to specify important aspects of the phonological structure of particular languages, and to account, in a coherent and general way, for a variety of different types of phonological variation. Such variation includes allophonic variation and fluent speech alternations, as well as ‘coarticulation’ and speech errors. Finally, it is suggested that the gestural approach clarifies our understanding of phonological development, by positing that prelinguistic units of action are harnessed into (gestural) phonological structures through differentiation and coordination.},

Articulatory evidence from American English words with a variety of initial consonants and clusters shows that syllable-initial consonants form a global organization (indexed by a metric we term the C-center) that is coordinated with the syllable’s vowel gesture. For syllable-final consonants, however, the evidence suggests that a local organization is employed: The first postvocalic consonant gesture is coordinated with the vowel gesture. Implications of these different styles of organization for the perceptual and phonological structure of speech are discussed.},

The primary phonological differences between the dialects are a lexical shift in vowels and the presence of stop lenition in the Eastern dialects. While there exists a dialect continuum, the primary cultural and political distinction drawn is between Eastern and Western Gitksan. For reference, Gitksan is bordered on the west by Nisga'a, in the south by Coast Tsimshian and Witsuwit'en, in the east by Dakelh and Sekani, and in the north by Tahltan (the latter four of these being Athabaskan languages).},

In either case, this type of local assimilation is considered to result in (contextually) unmarked structures. This article presents data that highlights a previously unrecognised pattern: assimilation resulting in voicing (an ‘emergence of the marked’ effect). This pattern has implications for how markedness is expressed in grammar. It is argued here that voicing is a privative feature, and that faithfulness constraints regulating the feature [voice] yield a rich typology that includes emergence of both marked and unmarked patterns. In addition, this typology yields benefits that are lost if voicing is considered a binary feature. This is illustrated by extending the dynamics of this voicing typology to other laryngeal features, such as [spread glottis].},

Proposed cognate sets comparing words reconstructed for Proto-Totonacan (PTn) and Proto-MixeZoquean (PMZ) show regular sound correspondences attesting to the descent of these two languages from Proto-Totozoquean (PTz). Identification of sound correspondences facilitates reconstruction of PTz’s phonological inventory and vocabulary. The PMZ words used in the comparison are from Wichmann (1995). The PTn words are reconstructed by the authors, who provide the Totonacan cognate sets on which these reconstructions are based, as well as discussion of the classification and phonological history of Totonacan languages.

I further contrast this movement with the movement involved in crossclausal agreement (Branigan and MacKenzie 2002) and show that the two differ in exactly the ways that A-movement and A¯ -movement differ. Algonquian languages clearly have A-movement as distinct from A¯ -movement.},

  abstract = {Phrasal idioms have been used as evidence in syntactic theorizing for decades. A common assumption, occasionally made explicit (e.g., Larson 2017), is that non-literal phrasal idioms differ significantly from completely literal collocations in the kinds of syntactic structures they can be built from. I show with a detailed empirical study that this is false. In fact, the syntactic constraints on idioms and collocations are identical. In particular, patterns that are missing from one are missing from the other, most strikingly ditransitives with a fixed first object and open second object (*throw the wolves X). Idioms and collocations should therefore be treated the same, as a broad class of conventionalized expressions. I propose a new analysis of the syntactic forms that conventionalized expressions can take. Unlike most previous analyses, I take the open slots to be part of the expression, and the task then becomes to explain the distribution of the open slots. A structural constraint on open slots accounts for the missing ditransitive pattern. It also explains why expressions with a fixed subject but open object are rare, but also why certain examples of this pattern do exist in English and in other languages.},

This paper tests whether the acoustic realisation of syllables support one widely adopted interpretation of lexical stress, according to which stress is either penultimate or final depending on syllable weight. The experiment reports on word-initial syllables that differ in presumed stress status. Target words were embedded in a carrier sentence within a scripted mock dialogue to ensure that the measurements reflect lexical stress rather than phrase-level prominence. Results from all four acoustic parameters tested (f0, duration, Centre of Gravity and vowel quality) showed that there were no differences as a function of presumed stress status, thus failing to support an interpretation according to which stressed syllables are acoustically differentiated. We consider the results in relation to previous claims and observations, and conclude that the absence of acoustic correlates of presumed stress is compatible with the view that Moroccan Arabic lacks lexical stress.},

  abstract = {There is no consensus on the nature, or even the existence, of Vietnamese word stress. While some authors have proposed that it is morphosyntactically conditioned (Thompson 1963, Thompson 1965, Cao 2003 [1978], Ngô 1984), others have adopted the view that it is consistently word-final (Trần 1967; Nguyễn \& Ingram 2006, 2007b; Phạm 2008; Nguyễn 2010) or that it lacks stress altogether (Emeneau 1951). This is due to the elusive nature of word prominence in Vietnamese, and to the small number of studies that tackle the issue experimentally. In this paper, acoustic experiments designed to test previous hypotheses and tease apart possible types of prominence are presented. Southern Vietnamese disyllabic words with various morphosyntactic structures were recorded in controlled environments to test for stress and phrasal effects. Their duration, mean intensity, mean f0, f0 range and formants were then measured to assess word prominence. Results suggest that there is little evidence for word stress in Southern Vietnamese and that reports of final stress can be reinterpreted as phrase-final lengthening. Focus-marking strategies bring no additional evidence for the existence of stress, but they seem to be partly speaker- and tone-specific, which supports results obtained in studies of Northern Vietnamese (Michaud 2005).},

Each of these perceptual cues is used for more than one tone, which suggests that listeners establish economical patterns of perceptual contrast. Although the two dialects under study share common identification cues, they also exhibit differences, especially with respect to the use of voice quality, which is an important cue in Northern Vietnamese but only plays a limited role in Southern Vietnamese. Results further suggest that Southern Vietnamese listeners can adjust their perception strategies to northern cues, which is expected since Northern Vietnamese is the standard national variety. Interestingly, the phonetic properties of tones (perceptual or acoustic) do not match the phonologically active tone classes of Vietnamese. Based on these results, previous models of Vietnamese tone features are challenged and a model of abstract tonal categories associated with a flexible phonetic knowledge is argued for.},

  abstract = {Southeast Asia is often considered a quintessential Sprachbund where languages from five different language phyla have been converging typologically for millennia. One of the common features shared by many languages of the area is tone: several major national languages of the region have large tone inventories and complex tone contours. In this paper, we suggest a more fine-grained view. We show that in addition to a large number of atonal languages, the tone languages of the region are actually far more diverse than usually assumed, and employ phonation type contrasts at least as often as pitch. Along the same lines, we argue that concepts such as tone and register, while descriptively useful, can obscure important underlying similarities and impede our understanding of the behavior of phonetic properties, typological regularities, and diachrony. We finally draw the reader’s attention to some issues of current interest in the study of tone and phonation in Southeast Asia and describe some technical developments that are likely to allow researchers to address new lines of research in years to come.},

Three main observations motivate the study: 1. Strong documentation and a relatively large and active speaker community create a unique opportunity to document information structure in Isthmus Zapotec and to study the language as it is used by speakers in everyday life; 2. As a tonal and verb-initial language, the examination of Isthmus Zapotec represents a chance to explore the possible combinations of tone, intonation, morphology and verb-initial syntax that may occur in the coding of information structure; and 3. The close analysis of spontaneous speech in an endangered language contributes to our theoretical understanding of information structure and informs our knowledge of language documentation practices and revitalization efforts. Overall, the analysis presented here demonstrates the value and need for information structure studies to document and analyze naturally-occurring data.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            It is well documented that the study of differences in grammaticality contrasts across the world's languages has implications for the synchronic study of preferential/frequency contrasts within a single language. Our paper extends this observation, arguing that the cross-linguistic study of both grammaticality and frequency contrasts can be crucial to the proper characterization of patterns of diachronic change. As an illustration of this proposal, we investigate patterns of synchronic and diachronic variation in the use of postverbal negative quantifiers (e.g.,               nothing, nobody, no book,               etc., as in,                                I know                 nothing                              ) versus negative polarity items under negation (e.g.,               not … anything, not … anybody, not … any book               , etc., as in,                                I do                 n't                 know                 anything                              ) in English. We show how a detailed comparison with similar patterns found elsewhere in closely related languages can give us a better understanding of which linguistic factors condition the use of these different kinds of indefinites in Modern Spoken English and a new perspective on a well-studied proposed change in progress in the English quantificational system.},

  abstract = {One of the most significant challenges in the study of speech production is to acquire a theoretical understanding of how speakers coordinate articulatory movements. A variety of work has demonstrated that articulatory, prosodic and extralinguistic factors all influence speech timing in a complex and interactive way. Models such as Articulatory Phonology that stipulate the relative timing of articulatory units must be revised to allow for this variability. Such a revision is outlined below.The following work should be viewed as a presentation of a new framework for conceptualising articulatory timing. This approach, meant to be programmatic rather than conclusive, is productive if it motivates research that might not otherwise have been undertaken. §1 overviews Articulatory Phonology. The implementation of articulatory timing in terms of phasing relations is discussed. Speech production data bearing on timing variability are discussed in §2. §3 argues for an alternative to Articulatory Phonology's current rule-based approach to intergestural timing that can allow for linguistic and extralinguistic variables to systematically influence phasing relations. §3.2 introduces the PHASE WINDOW framework, which allows the degree of articulatory overlap between linguistic gestures to vary within a constrained range. Finally, §4 concerns the relation of intergestural timing to the postulation of the segment as a primitive unit in phonology. It is hypothesised that certain intergestural timing relations are stable and lexically specified. Gestures whose coordination is constrained by lexical PHASE WINDOWS seem to bear a close relation to those conglomerates of gestures that constitute what is traditionally considered to be a segment.},

  abstract = {Choguita Rarámuri is a Uto-Aztecan language from Northern Mexico featuring both stress and tone in its word prosody, as well as postlexical intonation. Based on the analysis of instrumental data obtained through field research, this chapter describes how lexical tones in this language are realized in terms of fundamental frequency (f0); how tonal realization varies by phrasal position in declarative sentences; and also how correlates of voice quality help increase the acoustic differentiation across tones for some speakers. In addition, the chapter describes how tone and intonation interact and shows that the incorporation of f0 over pre- and post-tonic syllables generally improves the statistical discriminability of the three tones in utterance-medial position. Therefore, tonal contrasts in this language are as much about paradigmatic differences across the tone categories during the tone-bearing syllable, as they are about syntagmatic changes over at least three syllables centered around the tone-bearing syllable.},

Groups were assessed at seven time-points using standardised tests and parental reports. Results indicated that although FR and NoFR children had a similar development in the earlier years, the FR group appeared to perform significantly more poorly on vocabulary at the end of the preschool period. Results showed no significant effect of FR status on the cross-lagged relations between lexical and grammatical skills, suggesting a similar developmental pattern of cross-domain relations in both groups. However, FR status seemed to have a significantly negative association with vocabulary and grammar scores at age 6;0, resulting in language outcomes in favour of NoFR children.},

The models are evaluated on caregiver utterances in 132 CHILDES corpora representing 28 languages and 11.9 m words. PUDDLE shows the best performance overall, albeit with wide cross-linguistic variation. We explore the reasons for this variation, fitting regression models to performance scores with linguistic properties which capture lexico-phonological characteristics of the input: word length, utterance length, diversity in the lexicon, the frequency of one-word utterances, the regularity of phoneme patterns at word boundaries, and the distribution of diphones in each language. These properties together explain four-tenths of the observed variation in segmentation performance, a strong outcome and a solid foundation for studying further variables which make the segmentation task difficult.},

Three indigenous languages, Chorote, Nivaclé, and Wichí, are spoken here, but interlocutors in conversations usually do not speak the same language to one another. There is extensive linguistic exogamy, and husbands and wives typically speak different languages to one another. Individuals identify with one language, speak it to all others, and claim only to understand but not to speak the other languages spoken to them. Children in the same family very often identify with and thus speak different languages from one another. This situation is examined and explanations are offered, with comparisons to similar situations elsewhere. The pattern of language choice and multilingual use in this case is arguably unique, with implications for several general claims about language contact and multilingualism.},

  abstract = {"This volume presents the collective work of a team of twenty-one scholars that have investigated headless relative clauses in fifteen languages from five language families-all Mesoamerican but one. Headless relative clauses have received little attention in the linguistic literature, despite the many morpho-syntactic and semantic puzzles they raise within and across languages and for our understanding of human language in general. Headless relative clauses have been even more neglected in the study of Mesoamerican languages. This volume constitutes the first in-depth, systematic study of Headless Relative Clauses for any Mesoamerican languages we know of and the broadest and most articulated crosslinguistic study of headless relative clauses that has been conducted so far. For most of the languages in this volume, there is no descriptive or documentary material on wh-constructions in general, let alone headless relative clauses. Many of the languages are threatened or endangered; all are understudied. All of the chapters constitute original contributions to typological and theoretical linguistics. The first chapter introduces and defines the varieties of headless relative clauses that are investigated in the other chapters, compares them to two related and better-known constructions, namely headed relative clauses and wh- interrogative clauses, summarizes the main findings in a comparative prospective, highlights the importance of studying headless relative clauses to understand human language, and provides a methodological framework for the other chapters and future work. All the other chapters are language-specific and follow a uniform format to facilitate comparisons and generalizations across languages"--},

Here, I propose a novel account of opacity drawing upon developments in psychology. Rather than one grammar, I propose a dual-system model with implicit and explicit mechanisms, a domain-specific OT-like system and a domain-general rule-based system respectively. While the implicit system can handle most linguistic patterns, special cases like opacity require explicit acquisition. This predicts an advantage for explicit over implicit learning of opacity, and that elusive substantive bias may manifest by isolating implicit learners. In an artificial language experiment, participants learned opaque and transparent metathesis patterns. Despite participants’ difficulty acquiring the patterns, analysis shows a positive effect of explicit learning for opaque patterns. Additionally, implicit learners, but not explicit learners, show higher performance for substantively motivated vs. non-motivated patterns. These results tentatively support the dual-system account, and further exploration is warranted.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an Optimality Theoretic analysis of aspiration in the Scandinavian language Faroese using gestural score representations from Articulatory Phonology. In Faroese, a strong parallel exists between pre- and post-aspiration such that neither realization appears to be inherently preferred. This symmetry is straightforwardly captured by alignment within gestural scores, but runs counter to the treatments of pre-aspiration in traditional linear and autosegmental theories, where such segments are inherently more complex than their post-aspirated counterparts. An OT analysis that makes use of the alignment-based distinction in gestural scores is therefore proposed for the Faroese data. The account incorporates cross-linguistic preferences for post-aspiration and the correlation observed between stress and aspiration, yet pre-aspiration surfaces in many of the Faroese environments. Laryngeal alignment preferences are also analyzed as the basis of apparent contrast neutralization and sonorant devoicing in consonant sequences, and provide the framework for a grounded analysis of the interaction seen among consonant length, vowel quality and aspiration. Based on the analytic benefits of incorporating rich representational structure into the OT framework seen here and elsewhere, the potential for such theories to contribute to the advancement of phonological theory appears to be considerable.},

  abstract = {Distributivity in natural language occurs in sentences such as John and Mary (each) took a deep breath, when a predicate that is combined with a plurality-denoting expression is understood as holding of each of the members of that plurality. Language provides ways to express distributivity overtly, with words such as English each, but also covertly, when no one word can be regarded as contributing it. Both overt and covert distributivity occur in a wide variety of constructions. This article reviews and synthesizes influential approaches to distributivity in formal semantics and includes pointers to some more recent approaches. Theories of distributivity can be distinguished on the basis of how they answer a number of interrelated questions: To what extent can distributivity be attributed to what we know about the world, as opposed to the meanings of words or silent operators? What is the relationship between distributivity and plurality? Does distributivity always reach down to the singular individuals in a plurality? If not, under what circumstances is distributivity over subgroups possible, and what is its relation to distributivity over individuals?},

The children received a battery of language and early literacy tests when they were thirty-six months old. Findings showed that Taiwanese mothers adjusted their use of interaction strategies as their children grew. Maternal use of description, performance, prediction inference, and print-related talk were positively correlated with their children's language and literacy skills. Significant negative correlations were found between use of task-behavioral regulation strategy and text reading in mothers and their children's language performance. This study suggests that age-appropriate interaction strategies are important for children's language and early literacy development.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the interaction between different prosodic patterns in Quiaviní Zapotec (Otomanguean), and accounts for them both at the phonetic and the phonological level. In it, I examine an array of complex patterns along multiple dimensions, including metrical structure, tone, and phonation types; as well as how these patterns interact with the fortis/lenis distinction, and syllable structure. Within the framework of Optimality Theory, my analysis sheds light on the phonetics-phonology interface and emphasizes the need for a theory with moraic structure. 	This dissertation presents the first thorough phonetic documentation of the prosody of Quiaviní Zapotec. It makes a significant empirical contribution by providing descriptive generalizations of vowel and consonant length, a reanalysis of tone as contrastive in Quiaviní Zapotec, and a new approach to the study of the four-way phonation contrast in this language — modal /a/, breathy /a̤/, creaky /a̰/ and interrupted /aʔ/ vowels — (cf. Munro \& Lopez, 1999).  	In addition, this research makes significant contributions to phonological theory, with regards to both segmental and prosodic phenomena. Within an emergent feature approach, I revisit the fortis/lenis distinction, which crosscuts the obstruent-sonorant contrast in Quiaviní Zapotec. I analyze it as a composite of language-specific phonological and phonetic properties, encoded with the feature [+/-fortis]. Adding to the typology of syllable weight, fortis consonants are analyzed as moraic in coda position, but among them, only fortis sonorants may bear tone alongside vowels (i.e.  *[-SON][TONE] ‘No tones on obstruents’). 	Furthermore, I show specific timing patterns for the phonetic implementation of tonal and laryngeal features. Quiaviní Zapotec exhibits compatibility of contrasts; compromise of phonological features (e.g. tonal contrasts are cued during modal phonation, followed by breathiness or laryngealization); or complete incompatibility, which translates into phonemic gaps. This distribution is formalized in terms of markedness interaction and grounded constraints (e.g. ‘If [+spread glottis], then Low tone’, accounting for the absence of high tone with breathy vowels). 	Overall, the thesis analyzes the minimal prosodic word in Quiaviní Zapotec (a bimoraic foot) as the domain where the full array of tonal and phonation type contrasts takes place, and illustrates particular mechanisms by which phonetic factors shape phonology.},

  abstract = {In previous research of tonal phonology, contour tones were assumed to be phonologically presented not only as a sequence of level tones but also as a single unit. Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP) constraints, by extension, were thought to prohibit identical level tones associated to adjacent terminal nodes (OCP-Terminal) and identical adjacent tonal units (OCP-Unit). This proposal has nevertheless been challenged theoretically and empirically. This study seeks to offer new experimental evidence to help solve the debate by comparing the learnability of the two OCP generalizations in an artificial grammar learning paradigm. In Exp I, we exposed disyllabic tonal patterns conforming either to OCP-Terminal or to OCP-Unit to two target groups of learners, who were then tested if they could extend the hidden generalization to their auditory acceptability judgment of novel disyllabic items. Exp II had the same exposure phase but required learners to produce novel disyllabic items with tonal combinations of their choice. In both experiments, the two target groups demonstrated signs of learning target OCP generalizations from different channels. Crucially, learners implicitly acquired the OCP-Terminal generalization but only learned the OCP-Unit pattern as explicit knowledge. These findings led us to conclude that OCP-Unit may not be involved in implicit and automatized phonological computation.},

We provide a synchronic description of these two types of sounds, and explore their similarities and differences. Xumi voiceless nasal consonants are described with reference to the voiceless nasal consonants / / and / / in Burmese and Kham Tibetan because Burmese voiceless nasals are the best described type of voiceless nasals, and are therefore used as a reference point for comparison; voiceless nasals in Kham Tibetan, which is in close contact with Xumi, represent a characteristic regional feature. The synchronic description is based on acoustic and aerodynamic measurements (the total duration of the target phonemes, the duration of the voiced period during the target phonemes, mean nasal and oral flow). Our study (i) contributes to a better understanding of voiceless nasals as a type of sound, (ii) provides a first-ever instrumental description (acoustic and aerodynamic) of the voiceless nasal glottal fricative [ ], as attested in a number of Tibeto-Burman languages of Southwest China, and (iii) suggests a possible phonetic basis for the observed dialectal and diachronic variation between voiceless nasals and [ ] in some Tibeto-Burman languages.},

  abstract = {Georgian, a South Caucasian language belonging to the Kartvelian  family,  is characterised by the ability of its consonants to combine in extensive  clusters. Among the possible combinations are a series of two-member  clusters which are argued to behave phonologically as single segments  (Tschenkeli 1958, Vogt 1958, 1971, Aronson 1982, 1991, Deprez 1988 and  others). They are known as ‘harmonic’ clusters, because the  laryngeal  quality is constant across the cluster. Its two members are both voiced  ([dg bg dγ bγ]), both aspirated  ([thkh tshkh  thχ tshχ]) or both ejective  ([t'k' ts'k' p'k' t'q' ts'q']).  They can occur either word-initially or in word-medial  position. Harmonic clusters do not contrast with identical sequences of  segments, except for sequences formed at the junction of two words.  There is no evidence that across word boundaries harmonic clusters are  derived by some sort of restructuring.The purpose of the present study is to review the phonological  arguments brought in the literature in favour of treating harmonic clusters  as single segments, and to look for acoustic evidence that would motivate  the distinction made between harmonic clusters behaving as single  segments, on the one hand, and simple sequences of consonants, on the  other hand. The study uses phonetic data to address the issue of  phonological representation. If the difference between a harmonic cluster  and a simple sequence of segments is present in the phonology, then it  should ideally also be visible in the acoustic signal, for example in the  presence or absence of a release burst, or in timing differences, as  suggested by previous studies of complex vs. simple segments in  various  languages (Maddieson \& Ladefoged 1989, Maddieson 1989, 1990). The  results show that the treatment of Georgian harmonic clusters as complex  segments is not supported by the acoustic data.The paper is organised as follows: § 2 presents the phonological  behaviour of consonant clusters in Georgian, § 3 reviews phonetic  evidence  for complex segments, and spells out the predictions made by the present  study. The acoustic study is described in § 4, followed by the presentation  and discussion of results in § 5. The conclusions and areas for further  study are presented in § 6.},

Analyses of MDEEs usually assume that the alternation is morphologically general, and that the sequences ‘repaired’ across morpheme boundaries are phonotactically well-formed in the lexicon. This paper examines the phonotactic patterns in the lexicon of two languages with MDEEs: Korean palatalisation and Turkish velar deletion. I show that Korean heteromorphemic sequences that undergo palatalisation are underattested in the lexicon. A computational learner learns a markedness constraint that drives palatalisation, suggesting a pattern of exceptional non-undergoing. This contrasts with Turkish, where the relevant constraint motivating velar deletion at the morpheme boundary is unavailable from phonotactic learning, and where the alternation is an example of exceptional triggering. These results indicate that MDEEs are not a unitary phenomenon, highlighting the need to examine these patterns in closer quantitative detail.},

  abstract = {In this special collection entitled Marking 50 Years of Research on Voice Onset Time and the Voicing Contrast in the World’s Languages, we have compiled eleven studies investigating the voicing contrast in 19 languages. The collection provides extensive data obtained from 270 speakers across those languages, examining VOT and other acoustic, aerodynamic and articulatory measures. The languages studied may be divided into four groups: ‘aspirating’ languages with a two-way contrast (English, three varieties of German); ‘true voicing’ languages with a two-way contrast (Russian, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese, two Iranian languages Pashto and Wakhi); languages with a three-way contrast (Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Yerevan Armenia, three Indo-Aryan languages, Dawoodi, Punjabi and Shina, and Burushaki); and Indo-Aryan languages with a more than three-way contrast (Jangli and Urdu with a four-way contrast, and Sindhi and Siraiki with a five-way contrast). We discuss the cross-linguistic data, focusing on how much VOT alone tells us about the voicing contrast in these languages, and what other phonetic dimensions (such as consonant-induced F0 and voice quality) are needed for a complete understanding of laryngeal contrast in these languages. Implications for various issues emerge: universal phonetic feature systems, effects of language contact on linguistic levelling, and the relation between laryngeal contrast and supralaryngeal articulation. The cross-linguistic VOT data also lead us to discuss how the distribution of VOT as measured acoustically may allow us to infer the underlying articulation and how it might be approached in gestural phonologies. The discussion on these multiple issues sparks new questions to be resolved, and provide indications of where the field may be best directed in exploring laryngeal contrast in voicing in the world’s languages.},

This book provides the first evidence that a unified analysis of the different types of relative clauses is possible – a step forward in our understanding. Using careful analyses of a wide range of languages, Cinque argues that the relative clause types can all be derived from a single, double-headed, structure. He also presents evidence that restrictive, maximalizing, (‘integrated’) non-restrictive, kind-defining, infinitival, and participial RCs merge at different heights of the nominal extended projection. This book provides an elegant generalization about the structure of all relatives. Theoretically profound and empirically rich, it promises to radically alter the way we think about this subject for years to come.},

  author = {Clayton, Ian D},
  date = {2010},
  institution = {{Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}},
  location = {{Chapel Hill, NC}},
  abstract = {This dissertation makes two contributions, one empirical, the other theoretical. Empirically, the dissertation deepens our understanding of the lifecycle and behavior of the preaspirated stop, an extremely rare phonological feature. I show that in most confirmed cases, preaspirated stops develop from earlier voiceless geminate stops, less commonly from nasal-voiceless stop clusters. When decaying, preaspirated stops typically develop into unaspirated voiceless stops, or undergo buccalization to become preaffricated. More rarely, decaying preaspirated stops may trigger tonogenesis, or undergo spirantization or nasalization. Phonologically, preaspirated stops usually function as positionally conditioned allophones of underlying aspirated voiceless stops contrasting with voiceless unaspirated stops. The dissertation tests three theoretical frameworks. First, the State-Process model (Greenberg 1978, 1969, 1966) claims that the synchronic distribution of linguistic features offers insight into their rates of innovation and transmission. Conventionally, the rarity of preaspirated stops is attributed to a presumed low rate of transmission: they are rare because they are hard to hear (Silverman 2003, 1997; Bladon 1986). However, the geographic and genetic distribution of preaspirated stops fit the State-Process model’s prototype of an infrequently innovated but robustly transmitted linguistic feature. Further, I show experimentally that preaspirated stops are no more difficult to distinguish from unaspirated stops than are much more abundant postaspirated stops. Second, the dissertation tests the success of two models, one cognitive, the other phonetic/diachronic, at accounting for two place-based asymmetries in Scottish Gaelic preaspiration. Whereas a conventional Optimality-Theoretic analysis of these asymmetries overgenerates, an analysis modified via Steriade’s P-map Hypothesis (2001a, 2001b) resolves this overgeneration. The P-map analysis depends on congruent perceptual scales, which the perception experiment (above) confirms: participants’ confusion rates closely match the place-based asymmetries observed in Gaelic. The competing “innocent misperception” model (Ohala 2005, 1993; Blevins 2004) depends on the presence of phonetic precursors to produce an ambiguous phonological signal, which listeners may interpret differently than intended by the speaker, leading to an alteration in a segment’s underlying form. A series of production experiments identifies potential precursors, but also reveals between-speaker variation more compatible with the Pmap account than “innocent misperception,” again lending support to Steriade’s hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Preaspirated voiceless stops, a well-documented feature of Scottish Gaelic (Ní Chasaide 1985, Clayton 2010, Nance \& Stuart-Smith 2013), have also been reported in the English spoken in the Hebrides island chain (Borgstrøm 1940, Wells 1982, Shuken 1984). However, a detailed description of preaspiration in Hebrides English has previously been unavailable. This paper presents the results of a phonetic study of preaspirated voiceless stops in Hebrides English, based on the speech of 24 English–Scottish Gaelic bilinguals from nine regions within the Hebrides island chain. The paper describes the effect of linguistic features on the duration and frequency of preaspiration, including place of articulation, word position, and vowel context. The paper also considers the role of social factors, including speakers’ geographic origin, age, and gender, finding that preaspiration is more frequent among women and among older speakers, especially older female speakers from Lewis. The paper concludes that preaspiration is likely to be an obsolescent feature in Hebrides English, rather than an innovative feature as in other varieties of English such as Tyneside or Aberystwyth (Docherty \& Foulkes 1999, Foulkes, Docherty \& Watt 2001, Hejná 2015).},

In Tongan, ergative subjects cannot freely extract, and both VSO and VOS word orders are possible. By contrast, ergative subjects in Niuean freely extract, but word order with two full DP arguments is strictly VSO. We argue that these differences stem from a single point of parametric variation in the syntax: the locus of absolutive case assignment (Bittner \&amp; Hale 1996; a.o.). In Tongan, absolutive is assigned by T0, such that the object must A-move past the ergative subject, giving rise to extraction restrictions and the availability of VOS word order. In Niuean, absolutive is assigned by\,v0; as such, there is no object A-movement, hence no extraction restrictions, and VOS is not possible.},

  abstract = {IntroductionOne of the major concerns of laboratory phonology is that of determining the nature of the transition between discrete phonological structure (conventionally, “phonology”) and its expression in terms of nondiscrete physical or psychoacoustic parameters (conventionally, “phonetics”). A considerable amount of research has been devoted to determining where this transition lies, and to what extent the rule types and representational systems needed to characterize the two levels may differ (see Keating 1985 for an overview). For instance, it is an empirical question to what extent the assignment of phonetic parameters to strings of segments (phonemes, tones, etc.) depends upon increasingly rich representational structures of the sort provided by autosegmental and metrical phonology, or upon real-time realization rules – or indeed upon some combination of the two, as many are coming to believe. We are only beginning to assess the types of evidence that can decide questions of this sort, and a complete and fully adequate theory of the phonetics/phonology interface remains to be worked out. A new synthesis of the methodology of phonology and phonetics, integrating results from the physical, biological and cognitive sciences, is required if we are to make significant progress in this area.The present study examines one question of traditional interest to both phoneticians and phonologists, with roots that go deep into modern linguistic theory. Many linguists have noted the existence of cross-linguistic preferences for certain types of syllable structures and syllable contacts. These have been the subject of descriptive studies and surveys such as that of Greenberg (1978), which have brought to light a number of generalizations suggesting that certain syllable types are less complex or less marked than others across languages.},

  abstract = {This study documents the relation between f0 and prevoicing in the production and perception of plosive voicing in Afrikaans. Acoustic data show that Afrikaans speakers differed in how likely they were to produce prevoicing to mark phonologically voiced plosives, but that all speakers produced large and systematic f0 differences after phonologically voiced and voiceless plosives to convey the contrast between the voicing categories. This pattern is mirrored in these same participants’ perception: although some listeners relied more than others on prevoicing as a perceptual cue, all listeners used f0 (especially in the absence of prevoicing) to perceptually differentiate historically voiced and voiceless plosives. This variation in the speech community is shown to be generationally structured such that older speakers were more likely than younger speakers to produce prevoicing, and to rely on prevoicing perceptually. These patterns are consistent with generationally determined differential cue weighting in the speech community and with an ongoing sound change in which the original consonantal voicing contrast is being replaced by a tonal contrast on the following vowel.},

The first objective consists in a critical analysis of the widespread assumption—which is based on lexicostatistics, sound changes, and lexical differentiation—that Stoney separated from the Dakotan group independently from Assiniboine. I show that many of the sound changes and lexical differences found in Stoney are shallow diachronically and cannot be used to sustain an early separation hypothesis. On the contrary, there are a number of shared innovations that indicate Stoney and Assiniboine descend from an immediate common ancestor, Proto-Nakoda. The second objective is to provide new data on Assiniboine dialectal divisions—specifically phonological reshaping of stems—that help clarify and further refine the internal dialectal divisions of Assiniboine and its historical and genetic relationships with Stoney.},

The focus is on the interaction of morphological case marking and the lexical semantics of verbs, proposing that the case marking pattern on a verb’s arguments are closely linked to the verb’s entailments, especially those relating to how the participants denoted by the verb’s nominal arguments participate in the event being described. Through empirical investigation of novel Samoan data, the chapter argues that ergative morphological case marking is linked to the agent argument’s status as a ‘self directed initiator’ of the event. In providing an analysis of this phenomenon, this chapter proposes a formal model of how a verb’s lexical semantics interacts with the morphological case component of grammar, employing insights from Optimality Theory.},

  abstract = {The English dative alternation has received much attention in the literature on argument structure acquisition in children. However, the data on the acquisition of this alternation have consistently revealed a counter-intuitive pattern: children look more proficient with the lower frequency prepositional form of the dative than with the higher frequency double object form (Conwell \& Demuth, 2007; Rowland \& Noble, 2010). This may be because the DO dative typically occurs with pronominal argument types in first post-verbal position, which may result in an over-reliance on stereotyped forms (e.g., give + me) for early comprehension and production (Conwell, O'Donnell, \& Snedeker, 2011). This paper presents three studies of the effects of the pronoun me on dative comprehension by three-year-olds. Children's comprehension of the DO dative improved significantly when the first post-verbal argument was pronominal; no other effects of pronoun use were significant. Children's experience affects their ability to use lexically general representations of syntactic structures.},

  abstract = {Assiniboine, sometimes referred to as Nakoda, is an American Indian language of the Siouan language family presently spoken by fewer than one hundred people in Montana (United States) and Saskatchewan (Canada). It is a member of a dialect continuum identified by Parks and DeMallie (Anthropological Linguistics 1992) as Sioux-Assiniboine-Stoney. The canonical sentence structure is subject-object-verb, also characterized by postpositions, head marking, and internally headed relative clauses. Morphological processes are primarily agglutinating. The phoneme inventory consists of twenty-seven consonants, including plain, aspirated, and ejective stops, and eight vowels, five oral and three nasal. The language is structure-preserving; consonant allophony is restricted to the phoneme inventory. Assiniboine has no nominal case system, no definite or indefinite articles, and no verbal tense marking. Clauses are marked as "potential" by means of a verbal enclitic and unmarked clauses are "realized," effectively creating a future/non-future distinction. The verbal system is split-intransitive (active/stative); the object pronominal affixes of active-transitive verbs coincide with the subject pronominal affixes of the stative verbs. Participant information is encoded on the verb so that nominal antecedents may be omitted from the clause, but the question of whether Assiniboine is a "pronominal argument" language remains open. Deverbal nominalization is highly productive, as are verb compounding and noun incorporation. Verbal prefixation and suffixation both occur, but verbal prefixation is more systematic. Suffixation occurs in all major word classes. Assiniboine has an elaborate system of post-verbal particles that express aspect and modality; in verb compounding, verbal enclitics attach to the matrix verb and objects of the complement remain on the complement. There is a complex system of motion verbs, analyzed here as consisting of four triadic modules that encode notions of deictic center, base, direction, and belonging. A chapter on kinship includes a description of respect speech and a comprehensive list of kin terms. Appendices include three texts, orthographic equivalencies, and a cross-dialect comparison of instrumental prefixes. The grammar is written in what has recently been characterized as "basic linguistic theory." This is the first comprehensive description of the phonology, morphology, and syntax of the Assimboine language.},

It is demonstrated that Polish in fact possesses two opposite laryngeal systems, corresponding to its two major dialects and yielding virtually identical phonetic facts, except for the phenomenon of Cracow sandhi voicing.},

This study presents a description and analysis of the language's morphologically conditioned verbal stress assignment. Specifically, I show that A'ingae verbal morphemes can be classified with two binary parameters: the presence or absence of prestressing and the presence or absence of stress deletion (i.e. dominance), which vary independently. I formalise my analysis in Cophonology Theory, a non-representational theory of the phonology–morphology interface, which captures morpheme-specific phonology with constraint rankings particularised to morphological constructions. I argue that while non-representational approaches such as Cophonology Theory can handle the facts of A'ingae stress deletion straightforwardly, representational approaches lack the expressive power necessary to capture the stress facts of the language.},

The presence of complex segments with multiple place is crucial to seeing this harmony pattern clearly. These patterns are best handled in the Agreement by Correspondence framework with an active CC-Ident[place] constraint.

  abstract = {In some languages, creaky voice is used over relatively long stretches of speech as a prosodic element, to convey emotion, and/or stylistically. A primary acoustic and perceptual cue to creaky voice quality is a low fundamental frequency. Previous research has shown that listeners can make fine-grained comparisons of speakers' habitual modal pitch, but this study focuses on how a combination of modal and nonmodal phonation affects the perception of habitual pitch. A perception experiment assesses whether listeners are more likely to rate a speaker's utterance as being holistically lower in pitch if it contains both modal and creaky voice than if it is fully modal speech. Results indicate that for female American English speakers with higher modal pitch, the inclusion of creaky voice leads listeners to rate such utterances as lower in pitch than fully modal utterances, but not for speakers with lower modal pitch. These results are consistent with studies showing that pitch perception interacts with nonmodal phonation, and they relate to previous observations that speakers may utilize nonmodal phonation to manipulate their intended habitual pitch.*},

The current study examines the appearance of phonation in voiceless obstruents in a corpus of read speech with 37 AE speakers. Linguistic factors such as phrase and word position, stress, and the preceding phoneme are examined and are shown to condition the presence and degree of phonation during the constriction period of stops and fricatives. The amount of phonation present is further analyzed by characterizing where in the constriction interval phonation appears. Carryover phonation (or bleed) from a preceding sonorant is most common for stops, while a trough pattern (phonation that dies out and then begins again before the end of the closure) is more prevalent for fricatives. These acoustic patterns, together with previous reports of laryngeal articulation and air pressure measures, have implications for the representation of laryngeal timing in a gestural phonology framework.},

Hooper argued against the existence of MSCs altogether. Hooper contended that all MSCs are expressible as, and so reducible to, syllable structure constraints. Hooper's argument for replacing MSCs with SSCs comes largely from Spanish data. A way of determining whether a constraint is an MSC rather than an SSC is by examining polysyllabic monomorphemic words. For example, if a constraint is posited between two segments based on monosyllabic monomorphemic words and that constraint is also relevant for the same segments in polysyllabic monomorphemic words, then that constraint is an MSC rather than an SSC.},

This paper argues that there insertion can be used to diagnose vPs with no external argument, ruling out transitives, unergatives, and also inchoatives, which are argued to project an event argument on the edge of vP. Based on the tight link between there insertion and low functional structure, I build a case for low there insertion, where the expletive is first merged in the specifier of a verbalizing head v. The low merge position is motivated by a stringently local relationship that holds between there and its associate DP; this relationship plays a crucial role in the interaction of there with raising verbs, where local agreement rules out cases of ‘‘too many theres’’ such as *There seemed there to be a man in the room. An account of these cases in terms of phase theory is explored, in which I ultimately suggest that there must be merged in a nonthematic phasal specifier position.},

What is still missing are approaches that supplement qualitative research on area-formation processes with quantitative methods. Taking a bottom-up approach, we bypass notional issues and propose to quantify area-formation processes by (i) measuring the change in linguistic similarity given a geographical space, a sociocultural setting, a time span, a language sample, and a set of linguistic data, and (ii) testing the tendency and magnitude of the process using Bayesian inference. Applying this approach to the expression of reflexivity in a dense sample of languages in northwestern Europe from the early Middle Ages to the present, we show that the method yields robust quantitative evidence for a substantial gain in linguistic similarity that sets the languages of Britain and Ireland apart from languages spoken outside of Britain and Ireland and cross-cuts lines of linguistic ancestry.*},

  abstract = {A new method to calculate a spectral harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) in speech signals is presented. The method involves discrimination between harmonic and noise energy in the magnitude spectrum by means of a comb-liftering operation in the cepstrum domain. Sensitivity of HNR to (a) additive noise and (b) jitter was tested with synthetic vowel-like signals, generated at 10 fundamental frequencies. All jitter and noise signals were analyzed at three window lengths in order to investigate the effect of the length of the analysis frame on the estimated HNR values. Results of a multiple linear regression analysis with noise or jitter, F               0               , and window length as predictors for HNR indicate a major effect of both noise and jitter on HNR, in that HNR decreases almost linearly with increasing noise levels or increasing jitter. The influence of F               0               and window length on HNR is small for the jittered signals, but HNR increases considerably with increasing F               0               or window length for the noise signals. We conclude that the method seems to be a valid technique for determining the amount of spectral noise, because it is almost linearly sensitive to both noise and jitter for a large part of the noise or jitter continuum. The strong negative relation between HNR and jitter illustrates that spectral noise measures cannot simply be taken as indicators of the actual amount of noise in the time signal. Instead, HNR integrates several aspects of the acoustic stability of the signal. As such, HNR may be a useful parameter in the analysis of voice quality, although it cannot be directly interpreted in terms of underlying glottal events or perceptual characteristics.},

The goal of this research is to clarify the relationship between working memory and the processing of complex sentences by exploring the performance of 28 French-speaking children with DLD aged five to fourteen years and 48 typically developing children of the same age in memory and linguistic tasks. We identified predictive relationships between working memory and the comprehension and repetition of complex sentences in both groups. As for syntactic measures in spontaneous language, it is the complex spans that explain the major part of the variance in the control children. In children with DLD, however, simple spans are predictive of these syntactic measures. Our results thus reveal a robust relationship between working memory and syntactic complexity, with clinical implications for the treatment of children with DLD.},

The interpretation of DIC involves a complex event which behaves as a single, integrated event by linguistic tests. Based on data drawn from different sources, we argue that DIC is an asymmetrical serial verb construction (Aikhenvald 2006). We propose an analysis of DIC in which V1 and V2 enter the semantic composition as lexical verbs, with V1 contributing a motion event and projecting a theme and a goal argument which are identified, respectively, with an agent and a location argument projected by V2. A morphosyntactic mechanism of feature-spread requires that the person and tense features be realized both on V1 and on V2, while, semantically, these features are interpreted only once, in a position from which they take scope over the complex predicate resulting from the combination of V1 and V2. The semantic analysis is based on an operation of event concatenation, defined over spatio-temporally contiguous events which share specific participants, and is implemented in a neo-Davidsonian framework (Parsons 1990).},

The study examines how coarticulatory glottalization (creaky phonation, glottal closure) coincides with coarticulatory pitch perturbations and spectral tilt changes on neighboring vowels. The onset of laryngeally induced F0 perturbation effects and the timing of changes in spectral tilt were examined using acoustic data from six speakers of the language. The results show that in contexts where substantial non-modal phonation spreads onto the adjacent vowel, greater pitch effects are observed. In contexts where abrupt glottal closure occurs, less coarticulatory changes in spectral tilt and pitch are observed on adjacent vowels. In addition, strong tonal effects are observed for certain spectral measures. These findings are discussed in relation to the literature on tonogenesis and coarticulatory pitch effects.},

  abstract = {Phrase-final position is cross-linguistically the locus of both processes of phonetic reduction and processes of phonetic enhancement. In tone languages, phrasal position is a conditioning environment for processes of tone sandhi/allotony, though such patterns emerge from local processes of tonal enhancement or reduction. The current article examines the production of tone in Yoloxóchitl Mixtec, an endangered language of Mexico with nine lexical tones and fixed, stem-final stress, across phrasal and utterance positions via three experiments. In the first two experiments, the findings show that speakers lengthen syllables and expand the tonal F0 range in utterance-final position. The effect of this range expansion is high tone raising, low tone lowering, and falling contour lowering. Rising contour tones undergo substantial leveling when produced in a non-utterance-final context, similar to Taiwanese Mandarin. These findings suggest that postural changes in F0 range are controlled, intonational effects in tonal languages and not paralinguistic. In the third experiment, we examine utterance-level declination and raising within sentences consisting entirely of level tones. We show that utterance-level F0 changes are independent from local tonal hyperarticulation effects in phrase-final position. Together, the experiments largely support prosodically-conditioned phonetic undershoot as a control mechanism in tone production and demonstrate how tonal complexity may constrain universal tendencies in speech production.},

Electroglottographic (EGG) and acoustic data were examined from original fieldwork on the Takhian Thong dialect. EGG data shows high open quotient (OQ) values for the breathy register, low OQ values for the tense register, intermediate OQ values for the modal register, and rapidly changing high to low OQ values for the breathy-tense register. Acoustic correlates indicate that H1-A3 best distinguishes between breathy and non-breathy phonation, but measures like H1-H2 and pitch are necessary to discriminate between tense and non-tense phonation. A comparison of spectral tilt and OQ measures shows the greatest correlation between OQ and H1-H2, suggesting that changes in the relative amplitude of frequencies in the upper spectrum are not directly related to changes in the open period of the glottal cycle. OQ is best correlated with changes in the degree of glottal tension.},

  abstract = {One of the most fundamental constructs of phonological theory past and present is ‘neutralization’, i.e. the merger of a contrast in certain contexts. It is as basic as such other constructs as ‘contrast’, ‘distinctive feature’, and ‘segment’. While there exists a substantial body of literature on the phonetics of various phonological constructs (e.g. acoustic correlates for features, acoustic invariance, descriptive phonetics of particular languages, instrumental measurement techniques and segmentation criteria), the phonetics of neutralization has largely been assumed on the basis of casual impressionistic phonetics. The assumption is that forms which are distinguishable phonetically and phonologically in certain contexts and/or levels of representation (e.g. intervocalic voiced and voiceless obstruents in German) are under certain other well-defined circumstances totally indistinguishable at the level of phonetics (e.g. only voiceless obstruents occur word-finally in German).},

This kind of prosodic system has stress-like properties, and func- tions similar to Kisseberth \& Odden (2003). Vail (1972) suggests that Tumbuka is a purely stress language. This paper argues, in contrast, that because Tumbuka High tone realization has tone-like properties, as defined in Hyman (2006; 2009; 2012; 2014), as well as stress-like properties, it cannot be considered a canonical stress language. It is proposed that the synchronic Tumbuka prosodic system evolved from one where contrastive High tone takes a phrasal domain through processes – formalizable as an OT factorial typology – which made phrasal prosody more transparently predictable by eliminating most tonal contrasts.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the role of phonetic cues to postnasal laryngeal contrasts, language-specific differences in the use of these cues, and the phonetic naturalness of the different cues. While many studies have shown that long stop closure duration is a well-established cue to voicelessness in the postnasal context (see, e.g., Cohn \&amp; Riehl 2012, who claim this to be a universal property), the present study focusses on the role of aspiration noise in maintaining a voicing contrast in the postnasal environment. It provides experimental data from the Bantu language Tumbuka to illustrate that aspiration noise can preserve a postnasal laryngeal contrast even when stop closure duration is short. Though typologically less common, we show that the use of aspiration as a cue is also phonetically motivated. Furthermore, we show that such phonetic motivation should not be directly incorporated into phonology (e.g., as markedness constraints in OT). Instead, we employ the BiPhon model (Boersma 2007), which allows for a strict distinction between the modules of phonetics and phonology, and which formalizes the mapping of phonetic cues onto phonological representations via cue constraints, avoiding the problem of phonetic determinism.},

  abstract = {This article surveys the history of contrast in phonology from Bell’s Visible Speech (1867) until Chomsky \& Halle’s Sound Pattern of English (1968). Phonological contrast can be viewed at the segmental and subsegmental (feature) levels. As contrast at the segmental level involves the phoneme, whose later history has been extensively documented, I concentrate on the origins of the concept in the work of Sweet. Subsequently, I focus on subsegmental-level contrast. After a look at its treatment in phonological analyses that operated without an explicit theory of features, I turn to Trubetzkoy, in whose work we find the seeds of later approaches. The article explores the foundations of the main methods of computing contrastive features: minimal differences and hierarchical feature ordering. It concludes with a discussion of contrast in early generative phonology and reviews some of the reasons for its decline at the end of the 1960s.},

  abstract = {The notion that phonological features are organized into contrastive hierarchies has been entertained at different times in the history of linguistics. My main focus will be on the motivation for such hierarchies: what principles govern the ordering of the features? I will show that they have been motivated by three different principles: a) Activity: to identify the contrastive features that are relevant to the phonological computation, b) Minimality: to minimize redundancy in phonological representations and to maximize the amount of information conveyed by each feature, and c) Universality: to express universal tendencies in the nature of phonological inventories and the order of acquisition of feature contrasts. These principles do not necessarily conflict in every case, but in practice situations arise where they lead in different directions. To some extent Jakobson and Halle (Jakobson \& Halle 1956; Halle 1959) and Clements (2001; 2003; 2009) appeal to all these principles, though they do so with differing emphases: Jakobson began by appealing to Activity, Halle came to stress Minimality, and Clements focused on Universality. I will argue on behalf of the centrality of Activity, which I understand to be the original and most compelling motivation for feature hierarchies.},

The interplay of morphological case marking, argument serialization, and animacy provides linguistic cues for the processing system to rapidly identify the thematic roles of the arguments. The present event-related brain potential (ERP) study investigates on-line brain responses during argument identification in Zurich German, a High Alemannic dialect, and in Fering, a North Frisian variety, which both exhibit reduced case systems as compared to Standard German. Like Standard German, Zurich German and Fering are Continental West Germanic varieties, and indeed argument processing in sentences with an object-before-subject order engenders a qualitatively similar ERP pattern of a scrambling negativity followed by a P600 in all tested varieties. However, the P600 component—a late positive ERP response, which has been linked to the categorization of task-relevant stimuli—is selectively affected by the most prominent cue for argument identification in each variety, which is case marking in Standard German, but animacy in Zurich German and Fering. Thus, even closely related varieties may employ different processing strategies based on the language-specific availability of syntactic and semantic cues for argument identification.*},

  abstract = {Greenberg (1963) formulated a number of implicational universals that refer to the order of various syntactic elements. He classified languages on the basis of their order of subject, object and verb into three types, which he labelled I, II and III, and which correspond to what are commonly known as VSO, SVO and SOV languages, respectively. Since that time, evidence for the existence of the three other logically possible orders, VOS, OVS and OSV, has been presented (see Keenan, 1978; Derbyshire \& Pullum, 1981, 1986), thus leaving us with a typology of six types. Lehmann (1973, 1978) and Vennemann (1974, 1976) collapsed these six types into two types OV and VO. Implicit in this move is the idea that the fundamental parameter is the order of verb and object and that the position of the subject is less important. In treating VSO, VOS and SVO as subtypes of the general type VO, the claim is that these three types are similar to each other in their other word order characteristics and different from OV languages. More recently, a number of linguists, including Comrie (1981: 90, 94–95; 1989: 96, 100–101), Mallinson \& Blake (1981: 379), Siewierska (1988: 18–19) and Payne (1990: 19), but most particularly Hawkins (1980: 199; 1983: 30), have criticized Lehmann and Vennemann for collapsing VSO, VOS and SVO languages into a single category VO. They all argue that the available evidence does not support the claim that SVO languages pattern like VSO and VOS languages. The purpose of this paper is to argue that, although some of these criticisms are not without merit, Lehmann and Vennemann were largely right: with certain well-defined exceptions, the word order properties of SVO languages differ little from those of VSO and VOS languages. In short, it will be shown that with respect to a large number of word order characteristics, we do find a basic split between VO and OV languages.},

  abstract = {The articulation of /t/ in American English varies according to linguistic and extralinguistic factors. Concerning social factors, word-final /t/ glottalization is seen more among speakers of African American English (Farrington 2018), younger speakers (Partin-Hernandez 2005, Roberts 2006), and women (Byrd 1994, Eddington and Channer 2010).             This paper examines the production and perception of /t/ in five US states: Indiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Utah, Vermont. For the production study, participants read a letter containing 24 prenasal word-medial /t/s (e.g., kitten) and 28 prevocalic word-final /t/s (e.g., not ever). For the perception study, 22 speakers recorded a unique sentence, each of which was manipulated acoustically in order to yield both oral and nasal releases of prenasal word-medial /t/ (e.g. button [bʌʔən] vs [bʌʔn̩]), as well as tap and glottal stop pronunciations of prevocalic word-final /t/ (e.g. not ever [nɑɾɛvɚ] vs. [nɑʔɛvɚ]). Next, these recordings were presented to participants who rated the speakers in terms of their perceived age, friendliness, pleasantness, rurality, education level, and whether they were from the same state as the participants.             The production results for prenasal word-medial /t/ (e.g. button) indicate that younger speakers produced oral releases more often than their older counterparts. Age also was related to the realization of prevocalic word-final /t/ as a glottal stop (e.g., not ever), such that younger speakers and women produced glottal stops more often than older speakers. In the perception study, speakers who used glottal stops were viewed as less educated and less friendly. Speakers who used oral releases were perceived as more rustic and less educated.             This paper contributes to the literature documenting the production and perception of /t/ in American English and to the literature that demonstrates the usefulness of using both production and perceptual data to study language variation (e.g., Brown 2015).},

We investigated three possible phonetic correlates of “t-dropping” by recording participants from Utah and other Western states reading a document containing several instances of /t/ followed by a syllabic nasal. The first possible correlate, actual deletion of /t/, was uncommon but occurred slightly more often in the mouths of Utahns. The second possible correlate was realizing /t/ as a glottal stop, which was actually done more often by non-Utahns than Utahns (89\% versus 81\%, resp.). The third correlate, releasing the glottal stop orally rather than nasally (e.g., [khiɁƏn] and [mawɁƏn] vs. [khiɁƏn̩] and [mawɁƏn̩]) is the most likely candidate for “t-dropping” since Utahns did this in 17\% of the cases compared to less than 1\% in non-Utahns. Logistic regression analysis of the data indicates that age, percentage of life lived in Utah, and gender were strong predictors of oral release; it was used most often by young females who had lived the majority of their life in Utah.},

  abstract = {The phonology-phonetics interface is broadly concerned with the question of how abstract knowledge of a language's sound system influences and is influenced by the physical processes of producing and perceiving speech. There are a multitude of models that aim to address this question, many of which make distinct and even contradictory claims. This dissertation uses evidence from tone and phonation in San Martín Peras Mixtec (SMPM; ISO: jmx) to narrow the hypothesis space of viable frameworks of the interface, arguing that two basic characteristics must hold of any successful approach. First, drawing from phonetic and phonological analysis of a highly-specific process of low tone spread in SMPM, I argue that phonological and phonetic units of representation are defined at distinct levels of granularity, and therefore that they constitute distinct levels of representation. By extension, if any framework is to successfully derive low tone spread, it must incorporate different levels of representation for phonology and phonetics. Second, I show that a rate-driven, phonetic process of laryngeal reduction in SMPM influences the application of a phonological alternation, which provides evidence that the language's phonetic system is able to non-trivially influence which phonological output makes it to the surface. I argue that, in order to account for laryngeal reduction in SMPM, any successful model of the interface must allow for phonetics to influence phonology, though this influence must be indirect. Finally, I outline a model of Phonetically-Informed Candidate Selections (PICS) that embodies these characteristics and compare it with other frameworks that implement the required characteristics somewhat differently, outlining the distinct typological predictions and empirical coverage of each approach. Ultimately, this dissertation aims to constrict the hypothesis space of potential approaches to the phonology-phonetics interface, with the ultimate goal of pushing forward the field's understanding of the nature of language users' multi-tiered knowledge about the sound systems of their languages.},

  abstract = {One function of prosodic phrasing is its role in aiding in the recoverability of syntactic structure. In recent years, a growing body of work suggests it is possi- ble to find concrete phonetic and phonological evidence that recursion in syntactic structure is preserved in the prosodic organization of utterances (Ladd 1986, 1988; Kubozono 1989, 1992; Féry and Truckenbrodt 2005; Wagner 2005, 2010; Selkirk 2009, 2011; Ito and Mester 2013; Myrberg 2013). This paper argues that the distri- bution of phrase-level phrase accents in Connemara Irish provides a new type of evidence in favour of this hypothesis: that, under ideal conditions, syntactic constituents are mapped onto prosodic constituents in a one-to-one fashion, such that information about the nested relationships between syntactic constituents is preserved through the recursion of prosodic domains. Through an empirical investigation of both clausal and nominal constructions, I argue that the distribution of phrasal phrase accents in Connemara Irish can be used as a means of identifying recursive bracketing in prosodic structure.

  abstract = {This dissertation is an empirical and theoretical study of sentence-level prosody in Conamara (Connemara) Irish. It addresses the architecture of the syntax-phonology interface and the relation between syntactic constituent structure and prosodic structure formation. It argues for a fully interactional view of the interface, in which the phonological form may be influenced by a number of competing factors, including constraints governing syntax-prosody correspondence, linearization, and prosodic well- formedness. The specific proposal is set within the framework of Match Theory (Selkirk 2009b, 2011), an indirect-reference theory of the syntax-prosody interface in which correspondence between syntactic and prosodic constituents is governed by a family of violable MATCH constraints. These constraints call for a one-to-one correspondence between syntactic and prosodic structure, to the extent that prosodic structure may be recursive under pressure from the recursive nature of syntactic phrases. However, this direct correspondence can be overruled by other interacting constraints, including prosodic markedness constraints and, as proposed here, other correspondence relations, as on the linearization of hierarchical syntactic structures. This dissertation argues that the distribution of pitch accents in Conamara Irish provides direct evidence for Match Theory. It is proposed that two phrasal pitch accents, L-H and H-L, demarcate the edges of phonological phrases, where L-H accents specifically target only those phrases which are recursive. Using the distribution of these pitch accents as indicators for the presence of prosodic boundaries, the dissertation investigates a variety of syntactic structures in both the clausal and nominal domain. It is argued that there is a close correspondence between syntactic and prosodic structure in default cases, but that this direct correspondence may be subverted in favour of a structure which better satisfies higher-ranked prosodic markedness constraints. Finally, this dissertation addresses pronoun postposing, a process pervasive in Irish dialects in word order appears to be sensitive to prosodic structure. This dissertation proposes to account for this phenomenon using the theoretical framework developed in the dissertation, in which the main patterns are accounted for through the interaction of MATCH constraints, prosodic markedness constraints, and a proposed violable constraint on the linearization of syntactic structure.},

  abstract = {The syntax-prosody interface concerns the relationship between syntactic and prosodic constituent structure. This paper provides an overview of theoretical advances in research on the syntax-prosody interface. Current theoretical work is situated historically, and is framed in light of the central research questions in the field, including (a) to what extent prosodic structure can be used as a diagnostic for syntactic constituent structure, (b) the significance of recursion in prosodic theory, and (c) how mismatches between syntactic and prosodic constituent structure are modeled in different approaches to the syntax-prosody interface. The paper concludes with a discussion of the current state of the field and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {In Lekeitio Basque, radical mismatches between the morphosyntactic phrase structure of a sentence and the phonological/prosodic phrase structure of the phonological output representation appear when one or more of the words of a sentence display(s) unaccentedness, i.e., lack(s) lexical accent. Evidence of these constituency mismatches is provided by the distribution of predictable phrasal edge tones and prosodic-structure-sensitive patterns of pitch downstep and upstep. A purely phonological, optimality-theoretic analysis of the mismatches is given. This phonological analysis relies on assuming that morphosyntactic constituent structure is spelled out as prosodic constituent structure in the input representation of the phonology module and that a language-particular ranking of purely phonological constituency faithfulness and markedness constraints relates the constituency of the phonological input to the constituency of the phonological output representation.},

  abstract = {The factors that influence English speakers to classify a consonant as ambisyllabic are explored in 581 bisyllabic words. The /b/ in habit, for example, was considered ambisyllabic when a participant chose hab as the first part of the word and bit as the second. Geminate spelling was found to interact with social variables; older participants and more educated speakers provided more ambisyllabic responses. The influence of word-level phonotactics on syllabification was also evident. A consonant such as the medial /d/ in standard is attested as the second consonant in the coda of many English words (e.g. lard), as well as in the single-consonant onset of many others; for this reason such consonants were often made ambisyllabic. This contrasts with the /n/ in standard, which is never the first consonant in a word-initial cluster (e.g. *ndorf) and, therefore, rarely made ambisyllabic in the experiment. Ambisyllabicity was also found more often when the vowel preceding the single medialconsonant was lax, or stressed, or when the medial-consonant was a sonorant rather than an obstruent. The idea that a stressed lax vowel in the first syllable conditions both the ambisyllabicity of the consonant and its geminate spelling is not supported.},

  abstract = {We discuss theoretical approaches to blocking effects, with particular emphasis on cases in which words appear to block phrases (and perhaps vice versa). These approaches share at least one intuition: that syntactic and semantic features create possible ‘‘cells’’ or slots in which particular items can appear, and that blocking occurs when one such cell is occupied by one form as opposed to another. Accounts of blocking differ along two primary dimensions: the size of the objects that compete with one another (morphemes, words, phrases, sentences); and whether or not ungrammatical forms are taken into consideration in determining the correct output (relatedly, whether otherwise wellformed objects are marked ungrammatical by competition). We argue that blocking in the sense of competition for the expression of syntactic or semantic features is limited to insertion of the phonological exponents of such features (the Vocabulary items of Distributed Morphology) at terminal nodes from the syntax. There is thus no blocking at the word level or above, and no competition between grammatical and ungrammatical structures. The architectural significance of these points is emphasized throughout the discussion.},

While string-vacuous NegS is possible in all Scandinavian varieties, there is a fair amount of cross-linguistic variation in non-string-vacuous NegS. In particular, the varieties contrast in which constituents can be crossed by NegS and whether or not crossing of a certain constituent requires the presence of an intervening verb. The paper presents the complex variation as to the distribution of negative objects in Scandinavian, using data from different sources, and outlines an analysis within Fox \& Pesetsky’s (2003, 2005a, b) cyclic linearization model, which accounts for this variation by differences in the availability of the intermediate positions non-string-vacuous movement is forced to proceed through.},

  abstract = {West Circassian displays prominent polysynthetic morphology both in the verbal and nominal domains and both syntactic categories are subject to the same morphological ordering constraints. I argue that despite these similarities, nominal and verbal wordforms in West Circassian are in fact constructed via two distinct word formation processes: while the verbal root and any accompanying functional morphology are pronounced as a single phonological word by virtue of forming a single complex syntactic head via head displacement, the nominal head and its modifiers are pronounced as a single word due to rules of syntax-to-prosody mapping. Such a division of labor provides an account for why only nouns, and not verbs, exhibit productive noun incorporation in the language: West Circassian noun incorporation is prosodic, rather than syntactic. The evidence for the existence of these two avenues of word formation comes from a systematic violation of morpheme ordering observed in verbal nominalizations. In terms of broader theoretical impact, the proposed analysis provides insight into what factors shape a polysynthetic language: while it is tempting to reduce polysynthetic morphology to either simple head displacement or just a consequence of mapping complex syntactic structure to a single phonological word without any head displacement, the West Circassian data show that neither of these mechanisms can be dispensed with.},

  abstract = {The problem addressed in this paper is a case of word order microvariation in Mainland Scandinavian: optional vs. obligatory Object Shift (OS). Following standard assumptions (see \textbackslash citealt\{Selkirk1996\}), weak object pronouns are assumed to be affixal clitics at PF which do not themselves have the status of prosodic words. Since adverbs (including negation), are unsuitable as hosts, weak object pronouns may undergo OS, in other words precede adverbs, ending up encliticized onto the preceding verb or subject. In standard Danish, OS is obligatory; the order adverb+weak pronoun is blocked. However, in Swedish, OS is optional, as is the case for some Danish dialects, spoken in the southeastern island area. In our paper we explain the distribution of optional vs. obligatory OS by the phonological properties of the two varieties. What “optional OS” in Swedish and varieties of Danish have in common is the occurrence of a tonal accent, which creates a larger phonological unit than the minimal prosodic word, a Tonal Unit. We propose that the mechanism that allows a weak pronoun to remain in the canonical position in Swedish and the southeastern island dialects in Danish, is the availability of tonal accent. The tonal accent enables the inclusion of the pronoun in such a unit. Standard Danish, on the other hand, lacks tonal accent altogether which is why OS is obligatory in this dialect.},

Our analysis builds on the observation that varieties with optional Object Shift (most Swedish dialects, South Danish dialects (e.g., Ærø)) also have a tone accent contrast. The in-situ word order in these varieties is licensed because tonal accent creates a prosodic domain that makes the incorporation of weak pronouns possible.},

Informed by instrumental examinations of the laryngeal articulatory mechanism, it revises our understanding of articulatory postures to explain the actions, vibrations and resonances generated in the epilarynx and pharynx. It focuses on the long-term auditory-articulatory component of accent in the languages of the world, explaining how voice quality relates to segmental and syllabic sounds. Phonetic illustrations of phonation types and of laryngeal and oral vocal tract articulatory postures are provided. Extensive video and audio material is available on a companion website. The book presents computational simulations, the laryngeal and voice quality foundations of infant speech acquisition, speech/voice disorders and surgeries that entail compensatory laryngeal articulator adjustment, and an exploration of the role of voice quality in sound change and of the larynx in the evolution of speech.},

Thirty-two speakers were recorded producing words with all seven tones; audio and electroglottographic recordings were made. Acoustic measures were: cepstral peak prominence (CPP), H1⁎, H2⁎, H1⁎−H2⁎, H1⁎−A1⁎, H1⁎−A2⁎, H1⁎−A3⁎, and H2⁎−H4⁎. Electroglottographic (EGG) measures were: closed quotient and derivative-EGG closure peak amplitude (DECPA). F0 and duration were measured. Results showed that the traditional tonal descriptions are accurate except for the high-level tone which is better described as rising and the mid-low tone, which is falling. Furthermore, the rising and low-falling tones are shorter than the other five tones. In terms of acoustic and electroglottographic measures, none of the measures tested distinguished all three phonation types at a given time point. Several measures, H1⁎, H1⁎−H2⁎, CQ, CPP, and DECPA, distinguished two phonation categories, suggesting that phonation contrasts are realized across several phonetic dimensions. Additional results showed that many of the acoustic and EGG measures were correlated with F0 and that closed quotient and DECPA were most strongly correlated with H1⁎−H2⁎.},

  abstract = {The majority of studies on phonation types have focused on low vowels due to the minimal effects of their first formant on harmonic amplitude. In studies of multiple vowel qualities, reports on the relationship between vowel and voice quality are mixed: some show similar formant frequencies across phonation types (e.g. Abramson, Nye \& Luangthongkum 2007, Khan 2012), while others show different formant frequencies depending on voice quality (e.g. Ren 1992, Kuang 2011). Results differ as to whether the degree of non-modal phonation varies (Andruski \& Ratliff 2000, Kuang 2011) or does not vary (Esposito 2012, Khan 2012) across different vowel qualities. The present study draws on innovations which allow for more accurate corrections for the effects of formant frequencies on spectral measures (i.e. Hanson 1995, Iseli, Shue \& Alwan 2007) to examine the relationship between vowel quality and voice quality, in eight languages – !Xóõ, Burmese, Gujarati, Jalapa de Díaz Mazatec, Mon, Santa Ana del Valle Zapotec, White Hmong, and Yi. While no significant difference in the degree of non-modal phonation due to vowel quality was found, results showed a crosslinguistic pattern in the relationship between vowel quality and voice quality: vowels with higher log(F1) and log(F2) values tended to be produced with creakier phonation, while vowels with lower log(F1) and log(F2) values tended to be produced with breathier phonation, but only on the measure H1*-H2*.},

Male and female speakers produced words in five prosodie positions: isolation (with focus, F0 higher than sentence-medial position), initial (focused, high F0), isolation (without focus, mid-range F0), medial (midrange F0), final (lower F0). Two acoustic measures of phonation, H1-H2 and H1-A3, were made for each vowel. Results were inconclusive as to whether one gender was creakier or breathier than the other, though they did suggest that there was a difference in the production of phonation. In addition, there was also a strong effect of F0 on phonation, but not of position independently of F0. While the three-way phonation contrast was present in all five prosodie positions, it was not always well-defined. The contrast was minimized in isolation with focus (high F0) and initial position (high F0).

The continuum of mutually intelligible standard languages, regional varieties, and dialects stretching from southern Jutland to eastern Finland share many syntactic patterns and features, but also present interesting syntactic differences. In this volume, Jan Terje Faarlund discusses the main syntactic features of the national languages, alongside the most widespread or typologically interesting features of the non-standard varieties. Each topic is illustrated with examples drawn from reference grammars, research literature, corpora of various sorts, and the author's own research. The0framework is current generative grammar, but the volume is descriptive in nature, with technical formalities and theoretical discussion kept to a minimum. It will hence be a valuable reference for students and researchers working on any Scandinavian language, as well as for syntacticians and typologists interested in Scandinavian facts and data without necessarily being able to read Scandinavian},

  abstract = {The existence of negative descriptions denoting events is controversial in the literature, since it implies enriching the semantic ontology with negative events. The goal of this article is to argue that the readings that have been called ‘negative events’—in contrast to sentential negation reading—should be analysed as inhibited eventualities. We will argue that the inhibited eventuality reading emerges when negation scopes over the verbal domain. Sentential negation, in contrast, scopes above the existential closure of the event variable. We will implement the analysis in a framework where the verbal domain combines symbolic objects that yield partial eventdescriptions. These descriptions do not entail the existence of a Davidsonian eventuality with time and world parameters until they transition to the aspectual level. We will show that an analysis on these terms can capture the empirical properties of non-sentential negation without the need to propose negative events as objects in the ontology.},

We recorded a mother interacting with her 24-month-old son, and with her 5-month-old son, producing nonsense words bin and din. We used these productions to determine if they had a differential effect on 14-month-old infants’ word–object association abilities. Females hearing the words spoken to the older infant, but not those to the younger, succeeded. We suggest that the task-appropriateness of utterances can support infant word learning.},

  abstract = {This thesis is a descriptive grammar of Skolt Saami, a Finno-Ugric language spoken primarily in northeast Finland by less than 400 people. The aim of this thesis is to provide an overview of all the major grammatical aspects of the language. It comprises descriptions of Skolt Saami phonology, morphophonology, morphology, morphosyntax and syntax. A compilation of interlinearised texts is appended. Skolt Saami is a phonologically complex language, displaying contrastive vowel length, consonant gradation, suprasegmental palatalisation and vowel height alternations. It is also well known for being one of the few languages to display three distinctive degrees of quantity; indeed, this very topic has already been the subject of an acoustic analysis (McRobbie-Utasi 1999). Skolt Saami is also a morphologically complex language. Nominals in Skolt Saami belong to twelve different inflectional classes. They inflect for number and nine grammatical cases and may also mark possession, giving rise to over seventy distinct forms. Verbs belong to four different inflectional classes and inflect for person, number, tense and mood. Inflection is marked by suffixes, many of which are fused morphemes. Other theoretically interesting features of the language, which are covered in this thesis, include (i) the existence of distinct predicative and attributive forms of adjectives, (ii) the case-marking of subject and object nominals which have cardinal numerals as determiners, (iii) the marking of negation with a negative auxiliary verb and (iv) the apparent verb-second phenomenon which is observed in clauses displaying an auxiliary verb. Skolt Saami is a seriously endangered language and it is thus hoped that this grammar will serve both as a tool to linguistic researchers and as an impetus to the speech community in any future revitalisation efforts.},

No less central to the field is Optimality Theory, an approach developed within (morpho-)phonology in the early 1990s. This 2003 book combines two themes of central importance to linguists and their mutual relevance in recent research. It provides an overview of the role of the syllable in OT and ways in which problems that relate to the analysis of syllable structure can be solved in OT. The contributions to the book not only show that the syllable sheds light on certain properties of OT itself, they also demonstrate that OT is capable of describing and adequately analyzing many issues that are problematic in other theories. The analyses are based on a wealth of languages.},

Parallels of this kind are best accounted for if both types  of phenomena are analysed within a unified framework, so similarities result from  the fact that both phonetic and phonological processes are subject to the same  constraints. A unified model of phonetics and phonology is developed and  exemplified through the analysis of parallel phonetic and phonological assimilation  processes.

  abstract = {In the early Spanish colonial period, the territory of Quito underwent a large-scale shift from multiple pre-Incan languages to a Quechuan language first introduced by the Incas and then adopted by the Spanish as the general language of colonial society. This article considers the evidence that these languages left linguistic effects that can still be detected in modern Ecuadorian Highland Quichua, contributing a large lexicon of non-Quechuan toponyms and influencing the development of unique morphosyntactic and phonological features that contrast with Peruvian Quechuan languages. It is concluded that there is considerable evidence that the toponymic lexicon of Quichua includes large numbers of cognate forms with modern Barbacoan languages and that many of the unique linguistic features of Ecuadorian Highland Quichua are similar to features of the Barbacoan languages, suggesting historical Barbacoan influence.},

  abstract = {In many languages with clitic or other weak pronouns, a Person-Case Constraint (Perlmutter 1971, Bonet 1991) prohibits certain combinations of these pronouns on the basis of their person features. This article explores the crosslinguistic variation in such constraints, starting with several closely related Zapotec varieties. These restrict combinations of clitics not just on the basis of person, but also on the basis of a finely articulated, largely animacy-based gender system. Operating within a larger combinatorial space, these constraints offer a new perspective on the typology of Phi-Case Constraints (ΦCCs) more generally. This typology has an overall asymmetrical shape correlating with the underlying syntactic position of pronominal arguments. We develop a principled theory of this typology that incorporates three hypotheses: (a) ΦCCs arise from how a functional head Agrees with clitic pronouns, subject to intervention-based locality (Anagnostopoulou 2003, Béjar and Rezac 2003, 2009); (b) the variation in these constraints arises from variation in the relativization of probes (Anagnostopoulou 2005, Nevins 2007, 2011); and (c) clitic and other weak pronouns have no inherent need to be licensed via Agree with a functional head. Under this account, the crosslinguistic typology of ΦCCs has the potential to shed light on the grammatical representation of person and gender.},

We show that, in French, a sequence of consonants resulting from the loss of schwa maintains some of the fine articulatory characteristics of the lexical form containing schwa. Such characteristics distinguish this sequence of consonants from an underlying cluster. Thus, we show that "d'rôle" 'some role', with the apostrophe indicating schwa loss, remains articulatorily distinct from "drôle" 'funny'. A perception experiment shows that the two types of sequences (CC and C'C) are only marginally discriminable by French listeners. However, when the subjects identify correctly the two types of sequences, the distinct characteristics identified in production play a critical role in the listeners' judgments.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an architecture for the mapping between syntax and phonology – in particular, that aspect of phonology that determines the linear ordering of words. We propose that linearization is restricted in two key ways. (1) the relative ordering of words is fixed at the end of each phase, or ‘‘Spell-out domain’’; and (2) ordering established in an earlier phase may not be revised or contradicted in a later phase. As a consequence, overt extraction out of a phase P may apply only if the result leaves unchanged the precedence relations established in P. We argue first that this architecture (‘‘cyclic linearization’’) gives us a means of understanding the reasons for successive-cyclic movement. We then turn our attention to more specific predictions of the proposal: in particular, the effects of Holmberg’s Generalization on Scandinavian Object Shift; and also the Inverse Holmberg Effects found in Scandinavian ‘‘Quantifier Movement’’ constructions (Rögnvaldsson (1987); Jónsson (1996); Svenonius (2000)) and in Korean scrambling configurations (Ko (2003, 2004)). The cyclic linearization proposal makes predictions that cross-cut the details of particular syntactic configurations. For example, whether an apparent case of verb fronting results from V-to-C movement or from ‘‘remnant movement’’ of a VP whose complements have been removed by other processes, the verb should still be required to precede its complements after fronting if it preceded them before fronting according to an ordering established at an earlier phase. We argue that ‘‘cross-construction’’ consistency of this sort is in fact found.},

  abstract = {It is well known that in sluicing constructions wh-dependencies can cross certain projections that are otherwise barriers to movement (Ross 1969, Chomsky 1972). This fact would follow under the assumption that the relevant barriers are somehow deactivated when phonologically deleted (“island repair”). The problem, however, is that another form of phonological deletion (VP-ellipsis; VPE) seems to be impossible in certain contexts where sluicing allows for island repair (Chung, Ladusaw, and McCloskey 1995, Merchant 2001).             Nevertheless, we argue against the conclusion that island repair is a special property of sluicing. The argument is based on two observations. First, the difference between sluicing and VPE seems too broad to warrant the conclusion that island repair is the distinguishing factor (Lasnik 2001). Second, the conclusion is directly refuted by other VPE environments where island repair is possible (Kennedy and Merchant 2000; Fox, in preparation). The argument leaves us with a puzzle that we attempt to resolve while still maintaining the null hypothesis that VPE and sluicing involve the same operation of deletion, differing only in the size of the deleted constituent. Our proposed resolution capitalizes on a special property of the relevant sluicing contexts—namely, the presence of an indefinite NP in the antecedent clause in a position parallel to that of a trace in the elided clause. We argue that given the parallelism conditions on ellipsis, this fact prevents the wh-phrase in the elided clause from undergoing successive-cyclic movement. The remaining option (one-fell-swoop movement) requires the deletion of all barriers, including those that would otherwise be circumvented via an intermediate landing site. Such deletion occurs in sluicing but not in VPE, which targets a smaller constituent.},

We argue here for the potential benefit of theory-driven statistical modeling, based on a case study situated at the semantics-pragmatics interface. Using data from a novel experiment, we employ Bayesian model comparison to evaluate the predictive adequacy of four models that differ in the extent to and manner in which grammatically generated candidate readings are taken into account in four probabilistic pragmatic models of utterance and interpretation choice. The data provide strong evidence for the idea that the full range of potential readings made available by recently popular grammatical approaches to scalar-implicature computation might be needed, and that classical Gricean reasoning may help manage the manifold ambiguity introduced by grammatical approaches to these. The case study thereby shows a way of bridging linguistic theory and empirical data with the help of probabilistic pragmatic modeling as a linking function.},

  abstract = {This grammar provides the first comprehensive grammatical description of Moloko, a Chadic language spoken by about 10,000 speakers in northern Cameroon. The grammar was developed from hours and years that the authors spent at friends’ houses hearing and recording stories, hours spent listening to the tapes and transcribing the stories, then translating them and studying the language through them. Time was spent together and with others speaking the language and talking about it, translating resources and talking to Moloko people about them. Grammar and phonology discoveries were made in the office, in the fields while working, and at gatherings. In the process, the four authors have become more and more passionate about the Moloko language and are eager to share their knowledge about it with others. Intriguing phonological aspects of Moloko include the fact that words have a consonantal skeleton and only one underlying vowel (but with ten phonetic variants). The simplicity of the vowel system contrasts with the complexity of the verb word, which can include information (in addition to the verbal idea) about subject, direct object (semantic Theme), indirect object (recipient or beneficiary), direction, location, aspect (Imperfective and Perfective), mood (indicative, irrealis, iterative), and Perfect aspect. Some of the fascinating aspects about the grammar of Moloko include transitivity issues, question formation, presupposition, and the absence of simple adjectives as a grammatical class. Most verbs are not inherently transitive or intransitive, but rather the semantics is tied to the number and type of core grammatical relations in a clause. Morphologically, two types of verb pronominals indicate two kinds of direct object; both are found in ditransitive clauses. Noun incorporation of special ‘body-part’ nouns in some verbs adds another grammatical argument and changes the lexical characteristics of the verb. Clauses of zero transitivity can occur in main clauses due to the use of dependent verb forms and ideophones. Question formation is interesting in that the interrogative pronoun is clause-final for most constructions. The clause will sometimes be reconfigured so that the interrogative pronoun can be clause-final. Expectation is a foundational pillar for Moloko grammar. Three types of irrealis mood relate to speaker’s expectation concerning the accomplishment of an event. Clauses are organised around the concept of presupposition, through the use of the na-construction. Known or expected elements are marked with the na particle. There are no simple adjectives in Moloko; all adjectives are derived from nouns. The authors invite others to further explore the intricacies of the phonology and grammar of this intriguing language.},

By means of a new experimental set-up which allowed us to monitor tongue-palatal contact patterns simultaneously with intraoral pressure variations 8 German native speakers were recorded. Temporal results and relative burst intensities were obtained from acoustic data, the potential overlap of alveolar and velar movements was obtained by tongue palatal contact patterns in the anterior and posterior regions, and a brief period of pressure rarefaction at alveolar release (negative pressure) was taken as evidence for clicks. On the basis of these data speaker specific evidence is provided for weak clicks in German.},

  abstract = {Japanese has two types of two-place motion verbs whose ‘objects’ can be marked as either accusative or oblique (accusative–oblique alternations). The accusative–goal verbs mark their objects with accusative case -o or the goal marker -ni, and the accusative–source verbs mark their objects with accusative -o or the source marker -kara. Previous studies describe systematic differences in the interpretation of the arguments of these verbs and the events they denote between the two structures. This study argues that these alternating verbs are variable behavior verbs that are linked to two distinct syntactic structures. The core evidence for this claim comes from the results of two acceptability judgment experiments with Japanese native speakers that examined: (i) selectional restrictions on the subjects of the alternating verbs and (ii) the ability of their subjects to license ‘floating’ numeral quantifiers. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the accusative–source verbs alternate between the transitive and unaccusative structures, whereas the accusative–goal verbs consistently behave like transitive verbs but assign two different structural cases to their objects. Thus, the study shows that there are multiple ways in which two-place motion verbs are mapped onto distinctive syntactic structures, whereby the core meaning of the verbs and their syntactic structures together determine their interpretation.},

In its simplest form, dependency locality holds that words linked in a syntactic dependency (any head–dependent relationship) should be close in linear order. We give large-scale corpus evidence that dependency locality predicts word order in both grammar and usage, beyond what would be expected from independently motivated principles, and demonstrate a means for dissociating grammar and usage in corpus studies. Finally, we discuss previously undocumented variation in dependency length and how it correlates with other linguistic features such as head direction, providing a rich set of explananda for future linguistic theories.*},

  abstract = {We update our understanding of the view that grammar regulates inter-segmental temporal coordination and present an extension of that view to a new domain: we argue that inter-segmental coordination is basic to prosody. It is the glue joining segments together differently in different languages (here, illustrated with examples from Arabic and Spanish) and orchestrates their unfolding in ways corresponding to constructs posited in theoretical analysis. The correspondence is one between organization in mind-brain and organization in vocal tract. Moreover, for both mind-brain and vocal tract, the organization is phonological and abstract. It is so because it holds over segments of various identities: in Arabic, the first segment in // is not prosodified as part of the same unit as // and this holds true also for //, // and so on, regardless of sonority. In contrast, in English or Spanish, a different organization holds. Crucially, uniformity in organization (same organization presiding over sequences with varying segmental makeup) does not imply uniqueness of phonetic exponents: prosodic organization is pleiotropic, simultaneously expressed by more than one phonetic exponent. Finally, two properties of coordination relations are underscored: lawful flexibility and abstractness. The first is revealed in the degrees of freedom with which movements corresponding to any given effector begin; the second in invariances of task-relevant kinematic signatures regardless of the effectors implicated in any given segmental sequence. Once again, abstract phonological structure is mirrored in vocal tracts via coordination relations holding across physiology and the particular modes of its operation.},

Discussing empirical data from Chirag, I present the puzzling behavior of person agreement, which shows selective sensitivity to arguments in the ergative, dative, and genitive cases. The primary evidence comes from the periphrastic causative, which displays some typologically unusual properties in case marking and agreement. I show that the ability to trigger person agreement is not an intrinsic property of ergative, dative, and genitive DPs in Chirag, but rather is endowed to the highest DP in T’s c-command domain over the course of the derivation. I propose that all non-absolutive subjects start out as DPs assigned inherent case and a theta-role by v, and that T further assigns structural nominative case to the DP in Spec,vP, thus making it accessible to φ-probes.},

We asked five- and seven-year-old children and adult controls to select which of two pictures of reversible actions matched the sentence they heard, while their looks to the pictures were tracked. Accuracy and eye-tracking data showed that agent-initial sentences were easier to comprehend than patient-initial sentences, but the effect of word order was modulated by voice. Moreover, our eye-tracking data provided evidence that, by the first noun phrase, seven-year-old children looked more to the target in the agent-initial compared to the patient-initial conditions, but this word order advantage was no longer observed by the second noun phrase. The findings support language processing and acquisition models which emphasize the role of frequency in developing heuristic strategies (e.g., Chang, Dell, \& Bock, 2006).},

  abstract = {San Felipe Jalapa de Díaz (Jalapa) Mazatec is unusual in possessing a three-way phonation contrast and three-way level tone contrast independent of phonation. This study investigates the acoustics of how phonation and tone interact in this language, and how such interactions are maintained across variables like speaker sex, vowel timecourse, and presence of aspiration in the onset. Using a large number of words from the recordings of Mazatec made by Paul Kirk and Peter Ladefoged in the 1980s and 1990s, the results of our acoustic and statistical analysis support the claim that spectral measures like H1-H2 and mid-range spectral measures like H1-A2 best distinguish each phonation type, though other measures like Cepstral Peak Prominence are important as well. This is true regardless of tone and speaker sex. The phonation type contrasts are strongest in the first third of the vowel and then weaken towards the end. Although the tone categories remain distinct from one another in terms of F0 throughout the vowel, for laryngealized phonation the tone contrast in F0 is partially lost in the initial third. Consistent with phonological work on languages that cross-classify tone and phonation type (i.e. ‘laryngeally complex’ languages, Silverman 1997), this study shows that the complex orthogonal three-way phonation and tone contrasts do remain acoustically distinct according to the measures studied, despite partial neutralizations in any given measure.},

  abstract = {Hmong languages, particularly White Hmong, are well studied for their complex tone systems that incorporate pitch, phonation, and duration differences. Still, prior work has made use mostly of tones elicited in their citation forms in carrier phrases. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of both the vowel and tone systems of White Hmong from recordings of read speech. We confirm several features of the language, including the presence of nasal vowels (rather than derived nasalized vowels through coarticulation with a coda [ŋ]), the description of certain tone contours, and the systematic presence of breathy and creaky voice on two of the tones. We also find little evidence of additional intonational f0 targets. However, we show that some tones vary greatly by their position in utterance, and propose novel descriptions for several of them. Finally, we show that                                                                      \$\textbackslash textrm\{H\}1\^\{\textbackslash!*\}\$                                               –H2               *               , a widely used measure of voice quality and phonation in Hmong and across languages, does not adequately distinguish modal from non-modal phonation in this data set, and argue that noise measures like Cepstral Peak Prominence (CPP) are more robust to phonation differences in corpora with more variability.},

  abstract = {Variation in voicing is common among sounds of the world’s languages: sounds that are analyzed as voiceless can undergo voicing, and those analyzed as voiced can devoice. Among voiceless glottal sounds in particular, voicing is widespread: linguists often expect the voiceless glottal stop [ʔ] and fricative [h] to be fully voiced, especially between vowels. In this study, we use audio recordings from Illustrations of the International Phonetic Alphabet published in the               Journal of the International Phonetic Association               to explore the extent to which glottal consonants and non-modal (breathy and creaky) vowels differ in terms of percentage voicing and voicing intensity in three phrasal positions. We find that voiceless [h] is only slightly less voiced than voiced [ɦ] in initial position. Between two vowels, both [h] and [ɦ] are as voiced as breathy vowels. Glottal stops and creaky vowels are both characterized by high percentages of voicing, but they differ in voicing intensity: in all phrasal positions, glottal stops generally have periods of strong and weak voicing, whereas creaky vowels are strongly voiced. In contrast, vowels described as ‘rearticulated’, ‘checked’, or ‘glottalized’ show similar drops in voicing intensity to glottal stops. We interpret these results through an articulatory lens: glottal consonants and non-modal vowels are both modulations in phonation resulting from laryngeal constriction and vocal fold spreading. We argue further that, because voicing during [ʔ] and [h] is largely predictable from respiratory and prosodic constraints, many cases of [ʔ] and [h] can be considered phonetically underspecified for voicing.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a production experiment investigating the phonetic parameters speakers employ to differentiate Yes–No questions from string-identical statements in Akan, a West-African two-tone Kwa language. Results show that, in comparison to the statement, speakers use a higher pitch register throughout the utterance as a global parameter, and falling f0, longer duration and higher intensity as local parameters on the final syllable of the Yes–No question. Further, two perception experiments (forced-choice identification and gating) investigate the perceptual relevance of the global parameter and the local final parameters. Results show that listeners cannot assess the higher pitch register information to identify the mode of a sentence early on. Rather, identification takes place when the local phonetic parameters on the final vowel are available. The findings point to the superiority of language-specific cues in sentence mode perception. It is suggested that Akan uses a low boundary tone that associates with the right edge of the intonation phrase (L\%) in Yes–No questions. The results are discussed from the point of view of question intonation typology in African languages. It is argued that a classification along the lines of functionally relevant cues is preferable to an impressionistic analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the production and perception of contrastively laryngealized vowels in Coatzospan Mixtec (CM), an Otomanguean language of southern Mexico. A production study focuses on four dimensions of the phonetics of contrastively laryngealized vowels for eight speakers: f0 excursions, amplitude drop, amplitude differences between the first and second harmonics, and overall vowel duration. The production study reveals that the implementation of laryngealized vowels is highly variable within and across speakers, and that these vowels cannot be characterized as creaky voiced, but rather must be viewed as produced along a continuum on which creaky voicing constitutes only the most extreme of one of the ends. Strikingly, it is shown that many tokens are realized with highly subtle cues, involving only minimal drops along the f0 and amplitude dimensions. Three perception experiments conducted in a field setting using synthetic speech examined the contributions of f0 drops and amplitude in cueing the percept of laryngealized vowels. These studies agree with the production data in that they reveal speakers to be highly tuned to small changes along the f0 and amplitude dimensions in the experimental stimuli. Taken together, the production and perception data (1) add to our knowledge of the phonetics of an underdescribed and endangered language; (2) add to our knowledge of how phonation types such as laryngealization on vowels can be implemented cross-linguistically; and (3) provide a more finely grained notion of the array of acoustic cues that implement the categorical, contrastive phonological property of vowel laryngealization. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Its contributions set out to test this approach against new phenomena or data from synchronic, diachronic and, for the first time in a Sandwich-related volume, psycholinguistic perspectives. With topics ranging from nickname formation to the IPP (aka 'Ersatzinfinitiv'), from the grammaticalisation of the definite article to /s/-retraction, and from the role of verb-second order in the acquisition of L2 English to the psycholinguistics of gender, the volume appeals to students and specialists in modern and historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, translation studies, language pedagogy and cognitive science, providing a wealth of fresh insights into the relationships of German with its closest relatives while highlighting the potential inherent in the integration of different methodological traditions.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, I investigate the properties of determiners in Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh (Squamish) Salish. Determiners in Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh behave significantly differently from the definite determiner “the” in English. Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh lacks a definite/indefiniteness distinction; all DPs can be used in both familiar and novel contexts, and are not required to refer to a unique entity. Instead, Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh determiners are split along deictic/non-deictic lines. I argue that deictic features on the determiners have consequences for the grammar in terms of (i) scope and (ii) implicature of uniqueness. If a DP is deictic, (i) it can take wide scope and (ii) any sentence containing it will carry an implicature of uniqueness. If a DP is non-deictic, (i) it must take narrow scope and (ii) any sentence containing it does not carry an implicature of uniqueness. I claim that non-deictic DPs are composed via Restrict and deictic DPs via Specify (cf. Chung and Ladusaw 2004). There is therefore no correlation between more structure and wide scope, but rather a correlation between features and wide scope. Deictic features allow DPs to take wide scope; the lack of features prevents DPs from taking wide scope. Determiners in Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh are quite different from determiners in better-known languages. Do determiners share anything in common cross-linguistically? I argue that Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh determiners and English “the” are both associated with domain restriction (cf. von Fintel 1994). Both non-deictic and deictic DPs are sensitive to the context in which they are used; in familiar contexts, they (usually) refer to the set of entities under discussion. Non-deictic DPs, which in terms of scope behave like bare nouns, must differ from bare nouns in this respect. Bare nouns (in languages which use articles) cannot be used in familiar contexts. They can only introduce new discourse referents. Non-deictic DPs can introduce new discourse referents, but can also refer to previously introduced discourse referents, and can also be used partitively. Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh determiners must be associated with domain restriction, whereas bare nouns cannot be. I propose there is a strict correlation between the syntax and semantics: if a determiner occupies D, it has domain restriction in its representation.},

Using maximum entropy models, I control for the substantial influences of lexical tone distributions and standardisation, and uncover phonological determinants of tone beyond these lexical and conventional factors. The most important phonological determinant of tone in the corpus was English voicing, while in the experiment it was English stress-aligned pitch contours. I argue that these distinct tonal adaptation patterns constitute two different perceptual mappings, one from F0 perturbations to tone and the other from English intonation to tone, both arising due to particular borrowing contexts. I suggest that increasingly close contact between English and Mandarin may lead to more intonation-driven tonal adaptation in the latest wave of borrowing. The maximum entropy approach holds promise for the analysis of complex cases of tonal adaptation in other languages.},

  abstract = {"This grammar of the Southern Unami language describes the phonology, the inflectional and derivational morphology, and some aspects of sentence and discourse structure. It does not include a formal treatment of syntax. The treatment of these topics in Delaware Verbal Morphology (Goddard 1979) has been entirely recast, and there are now sections on additional topics that substantially fill out the description of this often complex and idiosyncratic Algonquian language. The facts are presented discursively in small modules with examples. The phonemic transcription has been improved by distinguishing /sg/, /šg/, and /xg/ from /s/, /š/ and /x/ between vowels and after /n/. and by greater consistency in writing the contrast between /o/ and /u/, especially before /w/. The extensive phonological alternations are illustrated with examples of morphological contexts in which they characteristically appear. Static words, syllables, and segments (which have short phonemes inconsistent with the more usual phonological patterns) are treated. The inflection of nouns, pronouns, and verbs is described and illustrated with extensive paradigms, and particles, including enclitics, are treated. The processes of stem derivation are outlined for primary stems and for secondary stems (those derived from another stem). The types of reduplication are described. Several kinds of compounds are distinguished and illustrated. The basic facts of sentence structure are presented, including the function of absolute and objective transitive verbs (to mark distinctions of definiteness) and the use of oblique complements and adjuncts. Other features discussed include verbless sentences, participles (relative clauses), focus-fronting, discontinuous constituents, and gapping. Southern Unami is the heritage language of the Delaware Tribe of Indians (Bartlesville, Okla.) and the Delaware Nation of Western Oklahoma (Anadarko)"--},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In this paper, I investigate the unusual order between case and possessive morphemes in the endangered Mongolic language Dagur. It is observed in many languages that the case morpheme follows possessive markers, but Dagur uniformly exhibits the morpheme order where possessive follows case in its nominal domain. Based on novel data from fieldwork, I propose that such order is due to postsyntactic Lowering, in which the head of K(ase)P lowers to Poss(essive) head. The evidence for the Lowering analysis comes from suspended affixation in this language. In particular, suspended affixation involving {$<$}small{$>$}CASE{$<$}/small{$>$} and {$<$}small{$>$}POSS{$<$}/small{$>$} morphemes displays unusual patterns, compared to the suspension of other types of morphemes. Further investigation reveals that Dagur suspended affixation is best analyzed as a base-generated structure, instead of morpheme ellipsis. Given these, the Lowering analysis correctly derives the {$<$}small{$>$}POSS{$<$}/small{$>$}-final order and successfully accounts for the unusual patterns in suspended affixation. In addition, I examine surface morphophonological differences between the {$<$}small{$>$}CASE{$<$}/small{$>$} and the {$<$}small{$>$}POSS{$<$}/small{$>$} morphemes, and show that they can be systematically encoded in the current theory.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The mechanism of constraint re-ranking basis makes Optimality Theory (OT) a typologically oriented theory of phonology. Permuting the prioritization of constraints on a language-specific basis generates a factorial typology of phonological patterns. Patterns generated by an optimality-theoretic account can be compared with the set of attested patterns found in languages of the world to determine how well the analysis fits the observed typology. The typological predictions of OT are constrained to a large extent by the grounding of markedness constraints in independent facts about speech articulation, perception, and processing. Nevertheless, comprehensive typological analyses within OT commonly overpredict the existence of apparently unattested patterns. These cases of overgeneration may stem from several sources: they may be pathologic, may reflect accidental gaps due to the paucity of a given phenomenon, or may be grounded in diachronic biases in speech perception or production. The phonetic underpinnings and factorial typology of three phenomena are discussed in this article: syllable structure, the distribution of contour tones, and the loci of laryngeal neutralization.},

The learner builds on the base grammar induced by the MaxEnt Phonotactic Learner (Hayes and Wilson 2008). Our model searches this baseline grammar for constraints that suggest nonlocal interactions, capitalizing on the observations that (a) nonlocal interactions can be seen in trigrams if the language has simple syllable structure, and (b) nonlocally interacting segments define a natural class. We show that this model finds nonlocal restrictions on laryngeal consonants in corpora of Quechua and Aymara, and vowel co-occurrence restrictions in Shona.},

We demonstrate that this strategy is successful in a wide range of cases, both in languages that supply clear phonotactic arguments for complex segments and in languages where the evidence is less clear. We then turn to the typological parallels between complex segments and consonant clusters: both tend to be limited in size and composition. We suggest that our approach allows the parallels to be reconciled. Finally, we compare our model with alternatives: learning complex segments from phonotactics and from phonetics.},

  abstract = {IntroductionIn many languages it has been observed that not all consonants are conveniently assigned a position within a syllable; those that fall outside a syllable are called extrasyllabic. A small sample of researchers who have examined the treatment of extrasyllabic consonants includes Steriade (1982), Clements and Keyser (1983), Borowsky (1986), Ito (1986), Rubach and Booij (1990a, 1990b), Lamontagne (1993), Rialland (1994), Sherer (1994), and Rubach (1997); the chapters by Cho and King, Féry, Kiparsky, and Wiltshire in this volume; and of course many others too numerous to mention here. These researchers have argued that when the potential for an extrasyllabic consonant exists, the consonant may become syllabified through vowel epenthesis, or may be deleted through stray erasure, or may be incorporated into higher prosodic structure. Only in the last case are the consonants in question extrasyllabic on the surface. The members of the prosodic hierarchy considered here include, from bottom to top: syllable (σ), foot (f), and prosodic word (henceforth pword, symbolized ω). See Selkirk 1980, 1984, 1995, Booij 1983, Inkelas and Zec 1995, and many others for discussion of the roles of these elements in the prosodic hierarchy.In this chapter I examine the behavior of consonant clusters at the left edges of prosodic categories from the perspective of Optimality Theory (OT – Prince \&amp; Smolensky 1993), presenting evidence from Icelandic, Attic Greek, and Munster Irish to show that clusters that are not licit syllable onsets may nonetheless be licit left-edge clusters at higher prosodic levels.},

In the most constrained version of the theory, all phonological processes should be thus reducible. This hypothesis is tested by alternations that appear to be phonological but in which universal markedness principles appear to play no role. If we are to pursue the claim that all phonological processes depend on the interaction of faithfulness and markedness, then processes that are not dependent on markedness must lie outside phonology. In this paper I will examine a group of such processes, the initial consonant mutations of the Celtic languages, and argue that they belong entirely to the morphology of the languages, not the phonology.},

  abstract = {This paper explores morphologically-conditioned alternations in Mbat (Jarawan Bantu) verb stems. Some inflectional affixation in Mbat results in resyllabification. The singleton coda of a CGVC verb stem will become the onset of a new syllable following the addition of a vowel-initial suffix (e.g., Perfective -am). What is surprising is that this, in turn, triggers onset simplification in the stem itself (i.e., CV.C-am). Adding further complexity to Mbat is that these alternations are limited to verb stems containing mid vowels. Stems with low vowels retain their pre-vocalic glide upon suffixation (i.e., CGV.C-am). These outcomes have implications for at least two contemporary lines of inquiry in phonological theory: i) the prosodification and behavior of pre-vocalic glides, and ii) the formal connection between so-called M2 syllable margin positions (i.e., the second member of a complex onset and the sole member of a singleton coda). I illustrate that Mbat has something to contribute to current perspectives on both these fronts. In addition to the theoretical and typological contributions entailed herein, this paper is also significant in that it is the first formal linguistic study of a Jarawan Bantu language, a cluster of languages spoken primarily in eastern Nigeria.},

  abstract = {Decontextualized talk is assumed to be used only rarely when children are younger than 30 months. Motivated by Bühler's (1934/1999) linguistic theory that describes different dimensions of (de-)contextualization, we provide evidence that this kind of input can already be found in caregivers’ talking to their 12-month-old children. Such early input is characterized by being decontextualized on some dimensions while being grounded in the immediate context on others. In this way, parents may scaffold understanding of talk about the there-and-then. We also examined whether caregivers adapt decontextualized verbal input to individual trajectories in language development. We observed 59 parent–child interactions within a decorated room when children were 12 months old, and assessed the children's linguistic development at 12 and 24 months of age. However, we did not find differences in the input directed toward children with different trajectories in language development.},

This paper describes a pattern of morphosyntax–phonology mismatches in Muskogee. Muskogee verbs are spelled out at two phases, vP and CP, resulting in two phonological domains, which this paper models as ω-recursion. The vP phase and ωmin are mismatched: either vP-phase material is parsed outside ωmin – an undermatch – or CP-phase material is parsed inside ωmin – an overmatch. The mismatch pattern requires a parallel model of morphosyntax–phonology mapping to distinguish mismatches using gradient Align constraints, rather than categorial Match constraints. Additionally, a phase-based model must allow earlier cycles to be altered in later cycles, ruling out strict phase inalterability in phonology, while a Stratal OT analysis must send a word's first phase through the stem-level phonology, regardless of its ultimate phasal structure.},

Yaqui has been defined as a transitive-prominent language because two-place predicates taking accusative arguments marked by -ta are extremely common, while predicates taking indirect/dative arguments marked by -u ‘to’ are uncommon. In addition to -u, there are several other predicates that take arguments marked by -t ‘at’. Two-place predicates with non-accusative arguments have been treated marginally in Yaqui grammar. This article examines coding and behavioral properties of accusative and non-accusative non-actor arguments in Yaqui. Evidence is given to support the claim that Yaqui does not have dative case but instead uses two oblique markers, -u and -t. This article also argues that Yaqui shows two types of split argument coding: verbs taking oblique arguments only and verbs with alternative coding (accusative and oblique).},

  abstract = {Here we investigate the historical origins and acoustic correlates of a hypothesized tonal development in subdialects of the Nahuatl spoken in the Balsas River valley of central Guerrero state in Mexico. We hypothesize that some subdialects have developed high tone on a syllable preceding a syllable with a breathy-voiced coda [ɦ] ({$<$} *h). In subdialects retaining [ɦ], coda [ɦ] was found to slightly lower F0 on the tautosyllabic vowel, creating a high–low F0 contour beginning on the preceding syllable. We propose that tone was developed as a reanalysis of the F0 contour as a phonological tonal specification. Through this tonal development, hybrid stress and tone systems have arisen, as the historical penultimate stress accent described for Nahuatl generally has been retained in the tonal dialects. Though such systems are typologically rare, a comparison of the development of other such hybrid systems indicates that they follow a similar historical path. That is, a stress language develops tone through the reinterpretation of a coarticulatory F0 effect as a tonal specification. We suggest that hybrid stress and tone systems may be unstable: Our results indicate that the historical stress accent may be transitioning to tone in subdialects with innovated tone.},

After sketching the two approaches, we argue against three arguments Köhnlein advances in favour of the metrical analysis. We then show that one of the disadvantages incurred by the metrically derived tonal representations is the introduction of a novel and otherwise unsupported concept of a single tone that incorporates two morphologically different but phonologically identical tones. We also evaluate Köhnlein's (2018) more recent proposal to use the syllabic trochee to account for subtractive plurals in tonal dialects. Finally, we compare the predictive powers of the metrical and tonal analyses of the Arzbach dialect.},

  abstract = {In some Central Zapotec varieties, such as San Pablo Güilá Zapotec and Teotitlán del Valle Zapotec, a verb in the completive aspect undergoes a tone change in certain syntactic contexts. We argue that this phenomenon can be accounted for by considering that there are two completive prefixes, the segmental exponents of which are the same: one that does not provoke any tone change (completive) and the other that does (completive 2). We also propose that this tone change can be considered as an instance of a grammatical tone, especially the nondominant grammatical tone, where the grammatical tone interacts with the lexical tone of its host. The phenomenon discussed in this paper is of interest because the interaction of syntax and tone has not been studied in detail in Zapotec or more generally in Otomanguean languages.},

Small groups of three preschoolers (n = 30) and one adult were video-recorded during an intervention study in which new vocabulary words were explicitly taught. Adult use of taught words was coded for perceptual and linguistic cues and type of social interaction. Hearing taught words used in the book text and learning information about words’ meanings during play was positively associated with growth in word-learning. Adult use of words in responsive, or child-initiated, interactions was positively associated with word-learning growth in both book-reading and play, while adult-initiated use of words was negatively associated with word-learning growth in both settings.},

Answering this question and many others, this book provides an essential guide to the syntactic structure of German. It examines the systematic differences between German and English, which follow from this basic difference in sentence structure, and presents the main results of syntactic research on German. Topics covered include the strict word order in VO vs word order variation in OV, verb clustering, clause union effects, obligatory functional subject position, and subject-object asymmetries for extractions. Through this, a cross-model and cross-linguistic comparison evolves, highlighting the immediate implications for non-Germanic OV languages, and creating a detailed and comprehensive description of the syntactic differences that immediately follow from an OV type in contrast with a VO type like English. It will be of interest to all those interested in syntax and Germanic languages"--Provided by publisher},

For some, this includes aspects of both the surface phonetics together with systematic structural properties of the sound system; for others, phonology is seen as distinct from, and autonomous from, phonetics. The Routledge Handbook of Phonological Theory surveys the differing ways in which phonology is viewed, with a focus on current approaches to phonology. Divided into two parts, this handbook: Covers major conceptual frameworks within phonology including: Rule-based Phonology; Optimality Theory; Government phonology; Dependency phonology; and connectionist approaches to phonology; Foregrounds the central issue of the relationship between phonetics and phonology; Features 23 chapters written by leading academics from around the world. The Routledge Handbook of Phonological Theory is an authoritative and theory-neutral survey of this key field in linguistics, and is essential reading for students studying Phonology},

  abstract = {Multicultural London English (MLE) has developed a new pronoun, man, with a number of interesting properties. It can be interpreted as any person and number combination (1sg, 1pl, 2sg, 2pl, 3sg, 3pl), and at first blush appears the allow a generic impersonal reading. One central strand of analyses of the ‘generic’ or ‘quasi-universal’ interpretation of impersonal pronouns involves treating them as featurally impoverished pronouns which act as variables bound by a generic operator either high in the clause (Moltmann 2006; Sigurðsson and Egerland 2009, a.o.) or at the top of the DP (Ackema and Neeleman 2018). What is interesting about MLE man is that it seems to allow a generic reading while being generally resistant to binding: the pronoun never behaves as a bound variable, and so it could not reasonably be assumed that a generic operator can bind it. I show, however, that a closer look at the facts reveals that the quasi-generic interpretation, and all other possible interpretations of the pronoun, can be explained instead by assuming that it has a featureless person head, which introduces the full lattice of possible referents including speaker and addressee (following Harbour 2016), and then allowing contextually determined subsets of that full lattice to be picked out by a choice function, modelled on the epsilon operator of von Heusinger (2004). This novel data from MLE suggests that generic-like interpretations can arise even where generic binding is not possible, but that the traditional strategy of generating these interpretations are still needed to capture the full typology of impersonal pronouns.},

In contrast to previous approaches, which have treated dispersion as a goal explicitly encoded in the grammar, this paper shows that the cross-linguistic pattern follows automatically from the interaction of two independently motivated factors: phonological representations in which only contrastive features are specified, and the enhancement of these features in phonetic implementation. The merits of this approach are illustrated by examples involving both vocalic and consonantal inventories.},

In contrast to previous approaches, which have treated dispersion as a goal explicitly encoded in the grammar, this paper shows that the cross-linguistic pattern follows automatically from the interaction of two independently motivated factors: phonological representations in which only contrastive features are specified, and the enhancement of these features in phonetic implementation. The merits of this approach are illustrated by examples involving both vocalic and consonantal inventories.},

These are clitics, and they are found in most of the world's languages. In English the clitic forms appear in the same place in the sentence that the full form of the word would appear in but in many languages clitics obey quite separate rules of placement. This book is the first introduction to clitics, providing a complete summary of their properties, their uses, the reasons why they are of interest to linguists and the various theoretical approaches that have been proposed for them. The book describes a whole host of clitic systems and presents data from over 100 languages},

  abstract = {Phonological alternations in homorganic nasal–stop sequences provide a continuing topic of investigation for phonologists and phoneticians alike. Surveys like Herbert (1986), Rosenthal (1989), Steriade (1993) and Hyman (2001) demonstrate that cross-linguistically the most common process is for the postnasal stop to become voiced, as captured by Pater’s (1999) markedness constraint *NT. However, as observed since Hyman (2001), *NT alone does not account for all postnasal patterns of laryngeal alternation. In this paper, we focus on three problematic patterns. First, in some languages with a two-way laryngeal contrast, voiceless stops are aspirated postnasally, i.e. the contrast between NT and ND is enhanced, not neutralized. Second, in some languages with a three-way laryngeal contrast, the voicing contrast is maintained postnasally, while the aspiration contrast neutralizes in favour of aspiration. Third, in other languages with a three-way laryngeal contrast we find the opposite postnasal aspiration neutralization: aspiration is lost. We argue that an analysis based on perceptual cues provides the best account for this range of alternations. It demonstrates the crucial role of perceptual cues and laryngeal contrasts in a particular language while fitting the range of patterns into an Optimality Theoretic factorial typology that covers a wider range of postnasal laryngeal alternations than previous analyses.},

Given the unusual characteristics of the word-initial consonant contrast and its potential maintenance in domain-initial environments, this study sets to examine the extent to which amplitude and f0 can potentially characterise such a contrast in KM in addition to the cross-linguistically established acoustic correlate of closure duration. The production data involved elicited materials from sixteen KM native speakers. RMS and f0 values were measured at the start of the vowel following stops and sonorants produced in isolation (i.e. utterance-initial position) and in a carrier sentence (i.e. utterance-medial position). Results indicate that the consonant contrast is reflected in systematic differences in (i) vowel onset amplitude and f0 following the target consonant and (ii) the ratios of amplitude and f0 across two syllables of disyllabic words. There are also effects of utterance position, manner of articulation and voicing type on the magnitude of contrast between singletons and geminates with utterance-initial voiceless stops generally showing the greatest magnitude difference. The conclusion is drawn that the KM word-initial singleton/geminate consonant contrast can be associated with a set of acoustic parameters alongside closure duration.},

I show that these processes sometimes diverge in their distribution, supporting the existence of two phrasal domains in Italian. These domains are analysed using prosodic recursion. I then develop a novel formulation of MatchXP, according to which only syntactic XPs with phonologically overt heads, whether lexical or functional, are visible to the syntax–prosody mapping. This formulation is argued to be superior to versions of MatchXP that only match lexical XPs or that attempt to match all XPs, at least in Italian, suggesting that implementation of syntax–prosody mapping constraints may be subject to cross-linguistic variation.},

  abstract = {Despite their apparent simplicity, the structure of DPs containing “complement” CPs (what we will call DCs) has long been obscure. One major strand of investigation has attempted to assimilate DCs to (close) nominal apposition, implying that N and CP form a structural unit that then combines with D. Danish has two kinds of DCs, a bare DC with the superficial structure [D N CP] and a prepositional DC in which the CP is encased in a PP. Exploiting clues provided by the allomorphy of the definite morpheme, we argue that the bare and prepositional DCs have very different structures, neither of which can be assimilated to apposition between N and CP. We further show that the two kinds of DC have distinct semantic and pragmatic properties. We then argue that English also has two different structures for DCs, and that they are plausibly parallel to the structures we establish for Danish. We conclude by arguing that two distinct structures give rise to the “apposition” relation: in one case it is between coarguments of D and in the other it is nonrestrictive composition.},

  abstract = {In this paper I argue that initial consonant mutation in the Celtic languages does not involve synchronically derived phonological alternation, nor is it the product of full lexical listing of alternant wordforms. Rather, Celtic initial mutation involves associations of consonants represented in the lexicon which relate a specific initial consonant of a radical form to its associated mutation reflexes. Together with subcategorisation, which ensures that the correct mutation reflex of a wordform appears in the correct environment, the appropriate initial consonant is selected from an association of consonants extracted by the speaker from the recurring patterns in the language. It is these consonant associations, not full alternant wordforms, that are listed in the lexicon. The advantages to this approach are threefold: broad patterns are identified which full lexical listing obscures, the participation of neologisms in mutation is accounted for straightforwardly, and some of the motivation for diachronic reanalysis within the mutation system is made more apparent.

Though it might appear that all three forms are derived from a single underlying representation, with the surface forms representing a case of simple (morphophonological) allomorphy, in fact such an account is untenable: in this article we show that the interaction of phonetic, phonological, morphological, and lexical considerations all bear on selection of the correct form. The solution to the problem of choosing the correct form of the definite article involves the staggered insertion of various classes of lexemes over the course of the syntactic derivation, with content words inserted first and functional elements inserted later on. Evidence from initial consonantal mutation in Welsh further supports the view that lexical insertion takes place at di¤erent stages, rather than as a single operation. We also consider the properties of a number of functional elements in Welsh involving interactions between distinct parts of the grammar. Finally, we show how our solution also sheds light on the system of initial mutation, which displays some interesting features with respect to the functional items that trigger mutations.},

  abstract = {In Icelandic, and in most dialects of Faroese, the fundamental laryngeal stop contrast is one of aspiration. This contrast is neutralized in certain positions, following patterns which appear problematic for perceptually-based theories (licensing by cue). In postvocalic onset position, a cue-rich environment, the contrast is absent in Icelandic. Most dialects neutralize to unaspirated [p, t, k], whereas others have postaspirated [p               h               , t               h               , k               h               ] instead. In the latter case, the appearance of loanwords with intervocalic [p, t, k] is now creating an incipient aspiration contrast, undoing the previous neutralization pattern. The implications of these facts for Optimality Theory (Richness of the Base) are discussed. In certain dialects of Faroese, such postvocalic singleton onsets are realized as               PRE               aspirated [               h               p,               h               t,               h               k]. Curiously, this preaspiration is suppressed in precisely the contexts where it ought to be most salient. An OT analysis is developed to account for this distribution.},

  abstract = {Frankenduals, that is, duals composed (as in Hopi) of a 'singular' and a 'plural' morpheme, display a consistent asymmetry. A new typological study shows that the element closer to the nominal is sensitive to singularity, whereas the one sensitive to plurality is more peripheral. This pattern impacts the theory of morphology (dual featurally crosscuts singular and plural), morphosemantics (number features are sensitive to order of composition), and syntax and its interfaces (the features are interpreted and pronounced where they are merged, not copied and partially deleted). The resulting account instantiates Hale's (1986) idea that features are semantically broad, ontologically flexible, and category-independent.*},

Among children without reading disorder, language minority status was unrelated to phonological processing.},

More generally, the present enterprise is to be seen as part of a wider programme in which reduction phenomena, including those traditionally referred to as lenition, are examined for the light they shed on the internal structure of consonants.},

This is supported with attested examples from Mainland Scandinavian, Georgian, Spanish, and Greek, as well as shallow, well-accepted reconstructions from Slavic and Georgian. It is further supported by new reconstructions from Zoque (Mixe-Zoquean) and Andi (Northeast Caucasian). For example, in Old Norse the postposed article is a clitic, and there is a case ending between the noun stem and the article:               hest-s=in-s               ‘the horse (gen)’. The first               s               is trapped morphology, and it is subsequently lost:               hest-en-s               . Similarly, in pre-Georgian, the postposed article traps the ergative case marker, *-               n               : *               k'ac-n=ma-n               ‘the man (erg)’; it is subsequently lost:               k'ac-man               . We argue that the loss of trapped morphology is not sound change or another phonological process, but a morphological process.},

  abstract = {Gaagudju is a previously undescribed and now nearly extinct language of northern Australia. This grammar provides an overall description of the language. Australian languages generally show a high degree of structural similarity to one another. Gaagudju conforms to some of the common Australian patterns, yet diverges significantly from others. Thus while it has a standard Australian phonological inventory, its prosodic systems differ from those of most Australian languages, with stressed and unstressed syllables showing marked differences in realisation. Like many northern languages, it has complex systems of both prefixation and suffixation to nominals and verbs. Prefixation provides information about nominal classification (4 classes), mood, and pronominal cross-reference (Subjects, Objects, and Indirect Objects). Suffixation provides information about case, tense, and aspect. As in many languages, there is a clear distinction between productive and unproductive morphology. Gaagudju differs from most Australian languages in that a considerable amount of its morphology is unproductive, showing complex and irregular allomorphic variation. Gaagudju is like most Australian languages in that it may be described as a free word order language. However, word order is not totally free and strictly ordered phrasal compounding structures are significant (e.g. in the formation of denominal verbs).},

  abstract = {Likelihood-based regression models such as the normal linear regression model and the linear logistic model, assume a linear (or some other parametric) form for the covariates \$X\_1, X\_2, \textbackslash cdots, X\_p\$. We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form \$\textbackslash sum \textbackslash beta\_jX\_j\$ by a sum of smooth functions \$\textbackslash sum s\_j(X\_j)\$. The \$s\_j(\textbackslash cdot)\$'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor \$\textbackslash eta = \textbackslash Sigma \textbackslash beta\_jX\_j\$ is replaced by the additive predictor \$\textbackslash Sigma s\_j(X\_j)\$; hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.},

  abstract = {We define a saltatory phonological alternation as one in which sound A is converted to C, leaping over phonetically intermediate B. For example, in Campidanian Sardinian, intervocalic /p/ is realised as [β] – leaping over [b], which does not alternate. Based on experimental evidence, we argue that saltation is marked, i.e. a UG bias causes language learners to disprefer it. However, despite its marked status, saltation does occur. We survey its diachronic origins, and suggest that it is never introduced as a sound change, but arises only from a variety of historical accidents. For the formal analysis of saltation, we propose a new approach, based on Zuraw's (2007, 2013) *Map constraints and Steriade's (2001, 2009) P-map. This approach is more restrictive than previous proposals, and accounts for psycholinguistic evidence indicating an anti-saltation learning bias: saltation is disfavoured during learning because it is by definition not a P-map-compliant pattern.},

Spontaneous speech data from 4 speakers of the Tórshavn dialect were recorded, and their stop production was analyzed. The data show that the somewhat contradictory accounts of the phonological distribution of preaspiration in previous works partly reflect a lack of uniformity among subjects in the phonological distribution of preaspirated variants. Further, the production of preaspiration was found to have a high degree of contextual variation. Lastly, when compared with preaspiration in other Scandinavian languages, the detailed phonological distribution of preaspiration was found to differ considerably between languages, although some central characteristics are shared between all of them. The implications of these data for historical sound change are discussed.},

We begin by reviewing evidence that the processes underlying reference production and comprehension are incremental. We then examine how the descriptive content of definite descriptions is selected and processed against a rich context that contains both visual and linguistic information, finding gradient effects that need to be combined. We also discuss the nature of referential domains, concluding that a definite description is not interpreted relative to a single referential domain and is instead influenced by two (and possibly more) domains whose influence is combined. The range of these findings calls for a probabilistic framework of reference that can accommodate gradient patterns.},

This article analyzes more than 25 hours of video-recorded CDS in Iiyiyiuyimuwin (Northern East Cree) to enrich and expand the analysis of the morphosyntax of obviation, a characteristic feature of Algonquian languages. The article elucidates under-described properties of demonstratives, particularly in possessive constructions, to show the crucial roles that obviative demonstratives can play in disambiguating syntax and marking grammatical information not encoded by co-occurring nouns and verbs. Additionally, it explores some morphosyntactic conditions behind under-described variation in obviative forms within the expansive demonstrative paradigm. The usage of particular obviative variants seems tied not to grammatical features such as distance, animacy, or number but instead to whether demonstratives serve pronominal, adnominal, or equational functions.},

  abstract = {In the present study I am adducing arguments against the assumption that there is a discrete level of grammar where all syntactic operation has stopped and the assignment of phonetic values to the then existing structure (the output of transformations) begins.                            The concept of ‘surface structure’ has received the following definitions in Chomsky's various works: ‘a proper bracketing of the linear, temporarily given sequence of elements, with the paired brackets labelled by category names (that is a labelled tree diagram, with such categories as Sentence, Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase, Noun, and a small number of others serving as labels)' (Chomsky, 1966: 21), ‘the organization into categories and phrases that is directly associated with the physical signal’ (Chomsky, 1968:25). These definitions take the physical event of speech as a starting point, and refer to the organization of the sentence on this level (cf. Chomsky, 1965a: 15). One finds, on the other hand, that in the Chomskyan system ‘surface structure’ is also defined in terms of derivation, as the last item in a finite sequence of phrase-markers, the output of the transformations (Chomsky, 1970: 53 f., 87), and such surface structures ‘are mapped into phonetic representations by the phonological rules’ (ibid.: 54) and are assigned intonational contours by rules of phonological interpretation (ibid.: 77). This is summed up in the formula ‘phonology:                                P                 n                              →phonetic representation’ (ibid.: 87, where                                P                 n                              is the surface structure, the last phrase-marker).},

  abstract = {With regard to change in inflection, historical linguistics fundamentally relies on the concept of morphological analogy, which is held responsible for nearly all change not attributable to phonological factors. Despite its central importance, how morphological analogy operates has never been established. Two different opinions are held in contemporary linguistics. The first position assumes that morphological analogy modifies inherited inflectional forms, making them more similar to other inflectional forms. According to the second position, in the course of morphological analogy, inherited inflectional forms are not merely modified but rather are replaced by forms created entirely anew on a model pattern already present in the grammar. This research report tries to establish what kind of data may constitute the evidence sufficient to differentiate between the two views. It argues that all relevant data point to whole-word replacement as the only mechanism of analogical change in inflection.},

The purpose of the present study was to extend these results to speakers with laryngeal pathologies and to conduct tests using connected speech in addition to sustained vowels.

  abstract = {Resultatives in English and Dutch have developed special degree readings. These readings stem from a reinterpretation of the resultative predicate as indicating a high degree rather than an actual result. For example, when a parent says I love you to death, one need not call the cops, since the sentence is not about love turning lethal, but merely indicative of a high degree of affection. Such cases have often been noted in the literature as idiomatic, but this view ignores the fact that these are not isolated cases but productive constructions that can be used with a variety of verbs. We explore various resultative constructions in English and Dutch, and give a classification of the subtypes involved as well as their diachronic development from ordinary to degree interpretation. We link these subtypes to lexical semantic classes of verbs. Both English and Dutch show a steady growth in the lexical and structural diversity of degree resultatives throughout the early modern and contemporary periods (1600-2000). We focus in our paper on the period 1800-2000, for which we did an extensive corpus study using the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) and Delpher (a collection of digitized Dutch newspapers, journals, magazines, and other resources). One of our findings is that, similar to other types of expressive language, such as degree modification and emphatic negation, taboo expressions play a role in degree resultatives; in fact, their role is excessive. We outline a number of the commonalities among the semantic domains of expressive language used in resultatives.},

  abstract = {This study examines measures of the glottal airflow waveform, the electroglottographic signal (EGG), amplitude differences between peaks in the acoustic spectrum, and observations of the spectral energy content of the third formant (F3), in terms of how they relate to one another. Twenty females with normal voices served as subjects. Both group and individual data were studied. Measurements were made for the vowel in two speech tasks: strings of the syllable /pae/ and sustained phonation of /e/, which were produced at two levels of vocal effort: comfortable and loud voice. The main results were: 1. Significant differences in parameter values between /pTe/ and /a/ were related to significant differences in the sound pressure level (SPL). 2. An "adduction quotient," measured from the glottal waveform at a 30\% criterion, was sensitive enough to differentiate between waveforms reflecting abrupt versus gradual vocal fold closing movements. 3. DC flow showed weak or nonsignificant relationships with acoustic measures. 4. The spectral content in the third formant (F3) in comfortable loudness typically consisted of a mix of noise and harmonic energy. Inloud voice, the F3 spectral content typically consisted of harmonic energy. 5. Significant differences were found in all measures between tokens with F3 harmonic energy and tokens with F3 noise, independent of loudness condition. 6. Strong relationships between flow- and EGG-adduction quotients suggested that these signals can be used to complement each other. 7. The amplitude difference between spectral peaks of the first and third formant (F1 -F3) was found to add information about abruptness of airflow decrease (flow declination) that may be lost in the glottal waveform signal due to low-pass filtering. The results are discussed in terms of how an integrated use of these measures can contribute to a better understanding of the normal vocal mechanism and help to improve methods for evaluating vocal function.},

Our explanation of this asymmetry is based on phase theory— more specifically, a stricter version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition proposed by Chomsky (2001) . The effect is that, in a Theme passive, a Recipient object destined for the C-domain gets trapped within the lower V-related phase by movement of the Theme. The same effect is observed in Italian, a language in which only Theme passives are possible. A similar effect is also found in some Bantu languages in connection with object marking/agreement: object agreement with the Theme in a Recipient passive is possible, but not vice versa. We show that this, too, can be understood within the theory that we articulate.},

  abstract = {Selkirk 1984, 1986, Nespor \& Vogel 1986 and others independently argue that PrWd structure is built from morphological structure. In Optimality Theory, Generalized Alignment (McCarthy \& Prince 1993b) has been successful in encoding the close relationship between prosodic structure and morphological structure. However, surface syllabification renders morphological boundaries opaque in a compound /CVC-VC/, in which each Root of the compound is identified as a separate PrWd in a language such as Korean (Kang 1992). In such case, owing to the requirement of ONSET, the final consonant of the first Root of the compound must be syllabified as an onset, leading to PrWd-Root misalignment. However, we show that unique-onset syllabification is empirically not tenable in Korean; a variety of phonological phenomena suggest that this consonant must be syllabified as a coda, seemingly requiring an abstract syllabification and thus posing a challenge to Optimality Theory, in which abstract syllabification is impossible. This dissertation proposes that a Root juncture is in fact non-crisply aligned with a PrWd juncture. We further argue that the PrWd-final consonant which is followed by a vowel across a PrWd juncture is realized as ambisyllabic. This proposal is strongly supported by several Korean phonological phenomena and English flapping. We demonstrate in Korean that /n/-insertion is compelled to avoid an ambisyllabic consonant before a high front vocoid. We also show in Korean that overapplication of Coda Neutralization and underapplication of primary palatalization of a PrWd-final consonant before a high front vocoid across a PrWd juncture are due to the ambisyllabicity of the PrWd-final consonant. Additionally, we analyze primary palatalization, secondary palatalization and Umlaut in Korean (Iverson 1993, Kiparsky 1993 for Korean and Hume 1990). We will demonstrate that Umlaut is blocked across a secondarily palatalized coronal consonant before a high front vocoid. We propose that Umlaut and secondary palatalization are a single phonological phenomenon and secondary palatalization blocking of Umlaut results from a consipiracy to force the V-place of a high front vocoid to spread only once. vi},

  abstract = {Through an investigation of glottalisation in several languages of North America,  this article examines the role of perception in the grammatical distribution of  segments. Specifically, we consider the hypothesis that perceptual factors on the  timing of glottalisation in consonants determine the arrangement of such consonants  phonologically. Our conclusion is in the negative. In the cases we study,  the distribution of glottalisation appears to be governed by syllable structure, not  by glottal timing. We interpret the patterns presented as evidence for a modular  theory of phonetics and phonology rather than a theory where properties of  articulator timing are directly referenced by phonological constraints. Patterns of  glottalisation result from the interaction of phonological submodules that are  largely independent of each other, though properties of particular modules may  be influenced by phonetic factors.},

While these mechanisms have been situated in the presyntactic lexicon and a postsyntactic module, respectively, I argue that they can receive a unified analysis in terms of one syntactic operation called Coalescence, which bundles structurally adjacent heads in particular configurations. This eliminates redundancies in the architecture of the grammar while maintaining prior empirical coverage, and sheds new light on long-puzzling properties of head movement. The proposal is illustrated in the analysis of several patterns of head bundling in the inflectional and clausal domains.},

This work examines cross-linguistic variation in co-occurrence among non-article determiners (demonstratives, proper names, pronouns, possessors) and its implications for understanding nominal (DP) structure and its parametric variation. We present data from a range of language families, and show that languages vary in both the number and permitted combinations of non-article determiners within a nominal phrase. These patterns provide new evidence that the primary semantic components of nominal reference, person, deixis, identifiability, inclusiveness (Lyons 1999), correspond to syntactic features in a universal hierarchy: [PERSON]{$>$}[DEIXIS]{$>$}[INCLUSIVENESS]. Languages vary in how these features are bundled on functional heads; non-article determiners can co-occur only if their corresponding features are on separate heads.},

These patterns have been analysed as cases of prosodic prespecification, where morphemes select a non-default prosodic representation. I argue that prespecification approaches should be reconsidered, and that such patterns are predicted without morpheme-specific prosody in Gradient Harmonic Grammar, a weighted constraint system with gradiently active symbols. Exceptional prosodification effects result from the interaction of two influences on constraint penalties: (i) scaling of constraint violations by prosodic context and (ii) contrastive activity values in underlying forms. This interaction is illustrated with the distribution of French nasal vowels and linking [n]. This approach reduces the amount of structure posited for URs, and provides new arguments for a more uniform syntax–prosody mapping.},

Among the parameters that can differ among languages with contrastive pitch levels are the number of phonological levels, the domain of tone features, the presence or absence of accentual properties, whether contour tones behave as single units or sequences of levels, and the presence of downstep and other register phenomena. Tone can undergo vertical or horizontal assimilation as well as dissimilation. Tone can function lexically, morphologically, syntactically, or semantically. No other phonological features exhibit the long-distance effects found with tone. Examples chosen from languages from around the world illustrate the variety of behaviours associated with linguistic tone and, to some extent, the types of analysis that have attempted to account for them.},

  abstract = {Phonology is a rapidly changing and increasingly varied field, having traveled quite some distance from its original structuralist and generative underpinnings. In this overview I address the status of underlying representations (URs) in phonology, which have been rejected by a number of researchers working in different frameworks. After briefly discussing the current state of phonology, I survey the arguments in favor of vs. against URs, considering recent surface-oriented critiques and alternatives. I contrast three straightforward abstract tonal analyses against the potential arguments which accuse URs of being (i)~wrong, (ii)~redundant, (iii)~indeterminate, (iv)~insufficient, or (v)~uninteresting. Identifying two distinct goals in linguistics which I refer to as determining ‘what’s in the head?’ vs. ‘what’s in the language?’, I suggest, responding to some rather strong opinions to the contrary, that URs are an indispensable and welcome tool offering important insights into the typology of phonological systems, if not beyond.},

We show that with a well-defined set of predicates, including deontic modals and raising predicates, scope diminishment of NegDP is observed. We argue, nevertheless, that scope diminishment in these cases is not produced by A-chain reconstruction. We also show that A-chain reconstruction of the indefinite part is possible. We conclude that the claim that NegDP does not undergo reconstruction reduces to the observation that the negative ingredient cannot reconstruct, and we suggest why this should be so. If we are correct, the analysis removes an obstacle to the view that A-chains exhibit syntactic reconstruction.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explain the variation of Case alignment in the accusative side of the ergative split of Kaqchikel, Chol and Q’anjob’al (Mayan). In particular, I will address contrastive alignments found in their accusative side. In the accusative side of Kaqchikel, the intransitive subject and the transitive subject alike are cross-referenced by the absolutive morpheme (also known as the set B marker in Mayan linguistics). On the other hand, the object of a transitive verb is cross-referenced by the ergative morpheme (or the set A marker). In the accusative side of Chol and Q’anjob’al, by contrast, both the intransitive subject and the transitive subject are cross-referenced by the set A marker, while the set B marker cross-references the transitive object. This contrast is unexpected, given that these languages have a (nearly) identical biclausal structure for their accusative side, as I will claim building on Laka (2006) and Coon (2010a, 2013a): the aspectual predicate forms a biclausal structure with a nominalized clause. I will argue that the contrastive alignments found in Kaqchikel, Chol and Q’anjob’al follow from a parametric difference regarding the nominalization involved in the accusative side of these languages. It will be proposed that the Restriction on Nominalization (RON) holds for Kaqchikel, whereas it does not apply to Chol and Q’anjob’al: the nominalized verb must lack a syntactically projected external argument. The RON will be developed, based on a similar observation made for nominalizations in Greek and some Indo-European languages among others (Alexiadou 2001). As will be demonstrated, the presence or absence of the RON and the type of alignment patterns in the accusative side of the ergative split are causally connected.},

These can occur clause-medially and clause-initially, but generally not clause-finally. While clause-initial negated adjuncts move to the left-periphery triggering Negative Inversion for emphasis, clause-medial negated adjuncts are argued to occur in their first-merged position as vP-adjuncts. We relate the inability of clause-final negated adjuncts to express sentential negation to the loss of Prosodic-movement and Negative Concord in the transition from Late Middle English to Early Modern English. The eventual loss of Negative Concord is related to the reanalysis of negative words from non-negative (i.e. [uNeg]) to negative (i.e. [iNeg]). Upon loss of Prosodic-movement, reanalysis of negative words as [iNeg] results in the rise of Negative Inversion to express Focus.},

I analyse the phonologisation of a predictable phonological pattern in Welsh, with particular attention to identifying criteria for whether phonologisation has occurred. I argue for a model where phonologisation experiences bottom-up and top-down biases. From the bottom up, there is pressure to phonologise phenomena with a categorical distribution; from the top down, there exist formal constraints on featural specification. I focus on the requirement for featural specifications to obey the Contrastivist Hypothesis, which denies that redundant features can be involved in phonological computation, in the context of a framework with emergent features. I suggest that the Contrastivist Hypothesis provides a useful boundary condition for emergent-feature theories, whilst independent phonologisation criteria provide contrastivist approaches with a more solid conceptual underpinning.},

It is argued that both short-vowel stød and common Danish stød involve the attachment of a laryngeal feature to a prosodic node—specifically themora. In the case of short-vowel stød that mora lacks segmental content, as it is projected top-down due to local prosodic requirements, not bottom-up by segmental material. I show that this device provides an account of the distribution of short-vowel stød as arising from the interplay of constraints on metrical structure (both lexically stored and computed by the grammar) and the requirement formorae to be featurally licensed. The analysis provides further evidence for the analysis of ‘tonal accents' and related phenomena in terms ofmetrical structure rather than lexical tone or laryngeal features, and contributes to our understanding of the relationship between segmental and suprasegmental phonology in Germanic languages.},

  abstract = {In this paper I propose an analysis of the repairs of sonority sequencing violations in South Welsh in terms of a non-phonological process of stem allomorphy. As documented by Hannahs (2009), modern Welsh uses a variety of strategies to avoid word-final rising-sonority consonant clusters, depending in part on the number of syllables in the word. In particular, while some lexical items epenthesise a copy of the rightmost underlying vowel in the word, others delete one of the consonants in a cluster. In this paper, I argue that at least the deletion is not a live phonological process, and suggest viewing it as an instance of stem allomorphy in a stratal Optimality Theory (OT) framework (Bermúdez-Otero 2013). This accounts for the lexical specificity of the pattern, which has been understated in the literature, and for the fact that cyclic misapplication of deletion and diachronic change are constrained by part-of-speech boundaries.},

  abstract = {While recent work has made it abundantly clear that the metrical foot is fundamental for any understanding of the accent pattern of Japanese and its dialects, other features of these pitch accent systems are directly linked to the constraints aligning tonal melodies with prosodic structure. This paper presents some results on the microvariation in the pitch accent systems of the dialects of Kagoshima Prefecture: the main Kagoshima City dialect, and the separate dialects of Koshikijima island and the southernmost Kikaijima island (Ryukyu archipelago). All these dialects, except for the Kagoshima City dialect, are in serious decline in terms of numbers of speakers. We show that the accentual microvariation in Kagoshima Japanese is due to a simple reranking of the basic constraints aligning the accentual melodies HL and H. The difference in tonebearing unit between dialects (syllable- vs. mora-counting behavior), difficult to analyze as a parameter setting, follows from the ranking of constraints against tonal contours on moras and syllables.},

The chief innovation is that this analysis also applies to compounds, where it predicts the location of accent in compounds with “short” N2 (one or two moras) – so-called “preaccentuation” at the end of N1, which often does not coincide with the penultimate mora. In addition, the paper sketches an extension of the analysis subsuming the N2-initial accent characteristic of compounds with “long” N2 (three or four moras).},

  abstract = {Tetst’ıné is a dialect of Dëne Sųłıné (ISO: CHP) spoken in Canada’s Northwest Territories. The verb system of Tetst’ıné has only recently been described (Jaker and Cardinal 2020); this paper is the first to propose an analysis of the distribution of long and short vowels in Tetst’ıné prefixes. In Tetst’ıné, all long vowels in prefixes are derived from intervocalic consonant deletion, although not all cases of intervocalic consonant deletion result in a long vowel. Whether or not deletion of an intervocalic consonant results in a long or short vowel depends on a combination of two factors: the consonant that was deleted, and the morphological level to which the preceding prefix belongs. In this paper, I propose that the basic generalization about prefix vowel length can be stated in terms of Systematic Underspecification (Kiparsky 1993). I claim that prefix vowels, unlike stem vowels, have zero moras underlyingly, and only acquire a mora after passing through at least one level of the phonology. This analysis predicts that prefix vowel length ought to be subject to a Derived Environment Effect (DEE), for which there is indeed evidence. The pattern of mora insertion in Tetst’ıné prefix vowels is thus an example of the interleaving of phonology and morphology, and illustrates how phonological behaviour can be to some extent predicted based on morphological structure.},

In particular, Q-Theory does not eschew the association relation, in Q-Theory the tone-bearing unit is the vowel, and Q-Theory and Autosegmental Phonology are equivalent in terms of the constraints they can express. However, this formal analysis clarifies the truly novel contribution of Q-Theory, which is the empirical claim that all segments are tripartite.},

Essentially, a melody-local pattern is one in which constraints over an autosegmental melody operate independently of constraints over the string of tone-bearing units. This includes a range of local tone patterns, long-distance tone-patterns, and their interactions. These results are obtained from the perspective of formal language theory and grammatical inference, which focus on the structural properties of patterns, but the implications extend to other learning frameworks. In particular, a melody-local learner can induce attested tone patterns that cannot be learned by the tier projection learners that have formed the basis of work on learning long-distance phonology. Thus, melody-local learning is a necessary property for learning tone. It is also shown how melody-local learners are more restrictive than learning directly over autosegmental representations.},

  abstract = {Empirical evidence is provided for the existence of a discourse-related area between TP and vP in Jordanian Arabic (JA), a finding which is in line with Belletti’s (2004, 2005) model of the low IP area in natural languages. A two million-word corpus of naturally occurring data from JA, supported by grammaticality judgements from 50 JA speakers, reveals that the subject in VSO clauses of JA is mostly either a definite DP or a modified, indefinite DP, implying that a certain informational value (i.e., a topic or a focus) is assigned to the post-verbal subject in such clauses. Another piece of evidence, among many others, that substantiates this line of analysis comes from the distributional properties of the subject in VSO clauses with respect to the past tense copula ka:n ‘was’ and high vP adverbials. The subject appears to the right of the former but to the left of the latter. We take this as a good indication that the subject in VSO clauses moves to a structural position higher than vP adverbials, yet lower than T0. In order to account for the reason why the subject does not raise to Spec,TP in VSO clauses in JA, we adopt the Criterial Freezing approach to movement and chain formation (Rizzi 2004, 2005, 2006, 2014; Rizzi and Shlonsky 2007). Criterial positions, whose heads are endowed with a specific informational feature such as [TOP] or [FOC], are traps. The subject landing in Spec, Topic Phrase or Spec, Focus Phrase (of the low IP area) gets frozen in place, obtaining, as a result, the VSO word order on the surface.},

  abstract = {'Why should Cornishmen learn Cornish?' asked Henry Jenner (1848–1934) in the preface to this 1904 publication, dating from the beginnings of the Cornish revival. Jenner admits that 'the reason ... is sentimental and not in the least practical'. Born in Cornwall, but raised in south-east England, Jenner worked at the British Museum from 1870 to 1909 and was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He eventually retired to Cornwall where he became a leading figure in establishing the Old Cornwall Societies and the Gorseth Kernow. The Handbook begins by marshalling the evidence for the use of the Cornish language from the middle ages to the eighteenth century, and listing the manuscripts and books in which it is preserved. It describes the uncertainties surrounding spelling and pronunciation, and the complex system of initial consonant mutations, before explaining the parts of speech. It also includes a fascinating chapter on names.},

  abstract = {Many phonological phenomena require reference to information beyond the immediate context of segments and boundaries. Most commonly, the SYLLABLE has been employed as an additional phonological context, but determining the exact nature of syllables and their boundaries has proved notoriously difficult. One approach is to add resyllabification (Selkirk 1982, Borowsky 1986) or ambisyllabification (Kahn 1976, Gussenhoven 1986, Rubach 1996) to basic syllabification in an attempt to account for phenomena where syllabification alone is inadequate. In this paper we argue against this approach and argue for a second approach, the PROSODIC approach. The essence of the prosodic approach is that there is a HIERARCHY of prosodic categories, of which the syllable is one, any one of which can serve as the context for phonological rules. Essentially, the argument is that prosodic categories, independently required for a wide variety of phonological processes, are sufficient for accounting for all the phenomena that resyllabification or ambisyllabification have been used for, whereas the reverse is not true. Resyllabification and ambi-syllabification are invoked ad hoc for certain phenomena and cannot account adequately for the full range of processes that can be understood in terms of prosodic categories. Resyllabification and ambisyllabification are therefore superfluous and can be dispensed with, indeed must be dispensed with, in an explanatory theory of phonology.' We will first, in ? 1, outline the fundamental assumptions of the prosodic theory that we will use, introducing certain modifications to the theory as outlined in Nespor \& Vogel (1986). We will then discuss the relevance of experimental and anecdotal evidence for syllabification in ?2. ?3 will be 187 This is a considerably revised and expanded version of a paper originally presented at the Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto phonology workshop in February 1997 at the University of Toronto. I am grateful for the comments of the audience on that occasion. Margaret Stong-Jensen carefully read through numerous drafts and gave me many important suggestions. I thank Carlos Gussenhoven for providing me with a copy of his 1986 paper and Caroline Smith for a reference for ? 2. The editors, an anonymous associate editor and several anonymous reviewers for Phonology also provided many critical comments which have helped me to sharpen my ideas in a number of places. Any remaining errors are my own. We will not specifically argue against resyllabification, which seems to be much less of an issue than ambisyllabification. The conclusion that the prosodic approach is superior to both resyllabification and ambisyllabification still holds, however.

Such a distribution is consistent with an analysis in which the contrast is one of [voice]  and syllable-final stops are devoiced. It is also consistent with the view that in German  the contrast is between stops that are [spread glottis] and those that are not.  On such a view, the intervocalic voiced stops arise because of passive voicing of the  non-[spread glottis] stops. The purpose of this paper is to present experimental  results that support the view that German has underlying [spread glottis] stops,  not [voice] stops.},

Facts and arguments are presented that speak for the phonemic status of these sounds, in contrast to the widespread view that voiceless nasals in Icelandic are derived. It is shown, among else, that stops after voiced and voiceless nasals are phonetically identical. Due to this fact it is not possible on synchronic grounds to ascribe the distinction between voiced and voiceless nasals to a distinction among the following stops, unless phonological abstractness is used as an analytical tool. The rarely mentioned case of single word-initial voiced versus voiceless nasals (where no subsequent stop occurs) would require an even greater commitment to phonological abstractness if the derived status of voiceless nasals were maintained. Implications for linguistic phonetics and the IPA are discussed.},

Then we'll eat the pudding." This volume provides methods for the identification of i) cognates in syntax, and ii) the directionality of syntactic change, showcasing the results in the introduction and eight articles.

  abstract = {This paper examines the connection between certain island phenomena for long distance movement, and matching island conditions on focus projection. Based on a description of focus projection that Lisa Selkirk and Michael Rochemont formulate, I take the basic pattern to be that pitch accent on a word may license focus marking on a phrase only if the pitch accented word is not separated from the focus marked phrase by a phrase in Specifier position or in adjunct position. Long distance movement operations are similarly incapable of moving a phrase out of a phrase in Specifier or adjunct position. Using Chomsky's notion of "phase," I argue that this is because Specifiers and adjuncts are phonological phases, and make proposals about what movement and focus projection is that thereby derives this effect. I then propose an interpretation of Chomsky's Bare Phrase Structure that derives the phaseness of these phrases.},

We addressed this issue using communicative inventory data from 300 British English-speaking children aged 12 to 25 months. Using Bayesian regression, we modelled word understanding and production as a function of: (i) phonological neighbourhood density, (ii) frequency, (iii) length, (iv) babiness, (v) concreteness, (vi) valence, (vii) arousal, and (viii) dominance. Phonological neighbourhood density predicted word production but not word comprehension, and this effect was stronger in younger children.},

The results indicate that dative subjects are in the process of being replaced by nominative subjects. Moreover, dative subjects behave like nominative subjects in that they may trigger number agreement with the finite verb. It is hypothesized that dative subjects in Faroese have an unrealized nominative case assigned by T(ense) and this makes number agreement possible. This hypothesis is argued to account for certain differences between Faroese and Icelandic, most notably the fact that verbs with dative subjects take accusative objects in Faroese but nominative objects in Icelandic.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This monograph presents a new model of the internal syntax of nominal phrases. The model is mainly based on Scandinavian, since with the wide range of variation that Scandinavian displays in the nominal domain, despite the close genetic relationship between the different varieties, Scandinavian is particularly well-suited for explorations into nominal syntax. Among the topics covered are the basic syntactic structure of nominal phrases, definiteness, adjective phrases, possessors, relative clauses, and nominal predicates. The model is however meant to be a tool for analysing the nominal phrases of any language. While the base-generated structure is taken to be universally uniform, the model allows for variation in the feature makeup of individual elements, in the phonological realisation of the features, and in the movements that may or may not apply. Hence, as shown in the final chapter, patterns found in languages outside of Scandinavian can also be accounted for within the model.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that a postalveolar co-occurrence restriction (Obligatory Contour Principle, OCP) is a productive component of Slovenian phonology. We first examine whether an apparent OCP-based restriction on derived palatalization, previously observed in corpus data (Jurgec 2016), extends to novel forms via a goodness-rating task. We then explore the generality of the restriction across the lexicon, in non-derived novel words as well as derived forms. Our results confirm that native speakers judge derived palatalized nonce forms to be less acceptable when the stem contains another postalveolar, reflecting the pattern found in the previous corpus study. We further demonstrate that multiple postalveolars are dispreferred even in non-derived words, which suggests that the effect is a general case of OCP. This is additionally supported by effects of proximity (the restriction is stronger for postalveolars separated only by a single vowel than for those further apart from one another) and identity (the restriction is stronger for identical than non-identical postalveolars), reflecting cross-linguistic tendencies in the manifestation of OCP and non-local consonant dissimilation. Finally, we show that the restriction does not appear to apply to all places of articulation, suggesting that the co-occurrence restriction in Slovenian specifically targets postalveolars, and adding a previously unattested pattern to the typology of OCP phenomena on consonant place.},

First, the paper investigates nominalization in Persian to identify the height at which nominal structure is introduced. Using evidence from the distribution of various kinds of syntactic objects in the context of nominalization, it will be argued that nominalization occurs at the level of VoiceP (or just above it) in Persian. Next, the paper uses the findings about nominalization to provide an argument for a low position of sentential negation in the language. It will be shown that negation in Persian in included in the nominalized structure and, hence, negation has to be low. This proposal is weighed against previous accounts in the literature, which have taken negation to be high in the language.},

We home in on the use of subcategorization for regulating the behaviors of individual exponents (morphs, vocabulary items), in particular, for infixation and suppletive allomorphy. We compare two distinct approaches, (a) enriched subcategorization, which takes there to be one mechanism governing both infixation and suppletive allomorphy, with their differences coming from enrichments to the (single) condition on an exponent’s realization, and (b) split subcategorization, which teases apart a mechanism governing infixation (a condition on an exponent’s position) from one governing suppletive allomorphy (a condition on the choice/insertion of an exponent). On the basis of a number of empirical and theoretical considerations, we argue for the latter approach: subcategorization at the exponent level must be deconstructed into (at least) two distinct conditions/mechanisms.},

Three chapters on the lexicon and discourse, syntax, and phonology focus on traditional dialect but also refer to colloquial and vernacular Irish English, the use of dialect in literature, and the modern \&\#8220;standard\&\#8221; language, especially as found in the International Corpus of English (ICE-Ireland). A separate chapter examines the internal history of Irish English, from Irish Middle English to contemporary change in progress. The book includes an extended bibliographical essay and a set of sample literary texts and texts from ICE-Ireland. Continuing themes include the impact on Irish English of contact with the Irish language, the position of Irish English in world Englishes, and features which help to distinguish between Irish English in the Republic and in Northern Ireland.},

The observations and analyses stem from original fieldwork on all five languages and represent some of the first prosodic descriptions of the languages. The theory is shown to successfully derive a number of famous and less well-known asymmetries in wh- in-situ distribution in a variety of languages unrelated to those the theory was originally designed to analyse. Against the backdrop of data from eighteen languages, the theory is parameterized to account for wh- item distribution across typologically diverse languages"--},

A chief difference between this formalism and standard positional licensing is that it predicts that harmony whose goal is to place a feature in a licensing position may overshoot its target by extending beyond the licensing position. Centralisation harmony in Tudanca Montañés bears out this prediction: though harmony triggered by a final vowel typically stops at the stressed syllable, under particular circumstances it extends into the pretonic domain. Positive gradient positional licensing is indispensable in an account of this. It plays a central role in a gang effect that drives overshoot, an interaction that cannot be replicated with standard versions of positional licensing.},

  abstract = {The goal of this dissertation is to explore the phonetic bases of intervocalic lenition - specifically, voicing and spirantization of intervocalic stops. A traditional understanding of phonological patterns like these is that they involve articulatory effort reduction, in that speakers substitute an easy sound for a hard one. Experiment 1 uses a novel methodology to investigate whether voiced and spirantized productions are truly easier than their unlenited counterparts: the speech of intoxicated subjects is recorded and compared with their speech while sober, on the hypothesis that intoxicated subjects expend less articulatory effort. This experiment thus attempts to observe effort reduction in action in the laboratory. The results of Experiment 1 do not provide evidence that voicing and spirantization are effort-reducing; rather, intoxicated subjects exhibit an overall contraction of the articulatory space. Experiments 2 – 4 investigate whether an alternative account of lenition based on perception is viable. Results suggest that attested alternations such as spirantization of voiced stops are preferred on perceptual grounds to unattested alternations such as intervocalic devoicing. Thus, the hypothesis of the P-map (Steriade 2001) can explain the broad strokes of lenition, although differences by place of articulation found in Experiment 3 do not match well with the typology. I conclude with an analysis of intervocalic spirantization couched within Optimality Theory, and particularly Dispersion Theory, using constraints motivated by Experiments 1 – 4. Unlike previous accounts of lenition, this analysis invokes no constraints that directly favor lenited forms over unlenited ones, since no such constraints were motivated by Experiment 1. The constraints that are made available by the experimental results are nevertheless able to account for a sizeable portion of the typology of lenition. I conclude that articulatory factors say less about lenition than traditionally thought, and that perceptual factors say more - and that theories of phonology that are committed to taking phonetics seriously must take notice.},

  abstract = {In Harmonic Grammar, positional licensing interacts with faithfulness constraints in pathological ways: spreading a feature to a licensing position to satisfy positional licensing can incur many faithfulness violations, and if there are sufficiently many such violations, they gang up to block spreading. This problem is solved if positional licensing is recast as a positive constraint that rewards licensed features in proportion to the number of positions they are associated with, thereby countering faithfulness's multiple violations. This proposal provides support for positive constraints, calls into question arguments against gradient constraints and lays the groundwork for a sound theory of positional licensing in Harmonic Grammar.},

In an initial simulation of a 10-item lexicon, a statistical bias towards final devoicing and a similarity bias for words in the same paradigm to resemble each other combined to yield morphological leveling: word-final voiceless obstruents in one form spread even to morphologically related forms in which they were not word-final.  These simulations were incapable of modeling a language with voicing alternations, as attested in German and other languages with final devoicing.  However, the simulations were successful when the similarity bias was modified such that words were under pressure to resemble their morphologically related counterparts only when those counterparts were informative (i.e., not neutralized).  I conclude that in order for exemplar models to be descriptively adequate, they must implement paradigm uniformity among surface forms that is crucially asymmetrical.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews some basic elements of musical structure, drawing from work in traditional and cognitive musicology, ethnomusicology, psychology, and generative textsetting. Music features two different hierarchical representational components that can both be visualised in grid notation: metrical structure and event hierarchies (also referred to as Time-Span Reduction). Metrical structure is an abstract pattern of stronger and weaker points in time that form a temporal ‘scaffold’ against which auditory events occur, but is partly independent from those occurring events. Event hierarchies encode the constituency (referred to as grouping) and prominence of actually-occurring musical events. Basic principles of these components are illustrated with examples from Western children's, folk, and popular song. The need for both metrical hierarchy and event hierarchy is illustrated using mismatches between metrical and rhythmic structure. The formal, conceptual, and empirical features of musical metre are quite different from linguistic stress and prosody, despite the frequent analogies drawn between them. Event hierarchies, on the other hand, are shown to resemble linguistic prosodic structure with regard to all of these features.},

  abstract = {The relationship between syntactic structure and prosodic structure has received increased theoretical attention in recent years. Richards (2010) proposes that Japanese allows wh-elements to stay in situ because of a certain aspect of its prosodic system. Specifically, in contrast to some other languages like English, Japanese can prosodically group wh-elements together with their licensers. This prosodic grouping is phonetically signaled by eradication or reduction of the lexical pitch accents of intervening words. In this theory, a question still remains as to whether each syntactic derivation is checked against its phonetic realization, or what allows Japanese wh-elements to stay in situ is more abstract phonological prosodic structure, whose phonetic manifestations can potentially be variable. This paper reports an experiment which addressed this question, by testing whether there is eradication or reduction of lexical pitch accents based on the detailed analysis of F0 contours. Our analysis makes use of a computational toolkit that allows us to assess the presence of tonal targets on a token-by-token basis. The results demonstrate that almost all speakers produce some wh-sentences which show reduction or eradication of the lexical pitch accents, as well as some that do not. Those tokens that show reduction or eradication directly support the prediction of Richards’ (2010) theory. The variability observed in the results suggests that the property of Japanese that allows their wh-elements to stay in situ must be abstract, phonological prosodic structure, whose phonetic realizations can vary within and across speakers. We discuss several possible mechanisms through which such phonetic variation can arise.},

Japanese is frequently cited as an example of a language that belongs to the former group.

  abstract = {In this article we have two primary objectives: (1) to elaborate in some detail a theory of phonological representations embedded within a parametric framework, and (2) to apply this theory to a particular vowel system which displays some rather interesting properties. This work is a continuation of a collaboration on a programme of research on phonological theory begun in 1982 (cf. Vergnaud 1982; Kaye \& Vergnaud 1984; Kaye               et al.               1984, 1985, in preparation).This programme incorporates the view that phonology is to be regarded as a system of universal principles defining the class of human phonological systems. These principles underdetermine given phonologies in certain specific areas. A complete phonological system consists, then, of these principles along with sets of parameter values. Taken together, the principles and language-specific parameter settings give a complete characterisation of the phonological system under study. In this model, a phonological system contains no rule component. The observed phonological phenomena result from a combination of the general principles governing phonological representations and structures and the parameter values in operation in the particular language. We view this line of research as a continuation of the development of a theory of markedness (cf. Chomsky \& Halle 1968 (SPE); Kean 1975, 1979). At the moment of writing, this view of phonology remains a long-term objective of our research programme. However, an increasing number of phonological processes which were formerly considered to be manifestations of rules are now successfully derivable from the principles of Universal Phonology (UP) (cf. Kaye \& Lowenstamm 1984, to appear).},

  abstract = {Recent work has argued for derivational expansion of the search space of ɸ-probes as a result of the cyclic interaction of Merge and Agree (cyclic Agree). Empirical evidence for such effects has come from the interaction of Agree with external Merge, but these accounts make the additional predictions that such interactions should also arise from the interaction of Agree with movement. In this paper, we argue based on evidence from Hindi-Urdu that movement may feed cyclic Agree in the same way as external Merge, bearing out this key prediction. The central empirical generalizations that we argue for are that (i) A-scrambling of an object over a subject may feed agreement in certain configurations, (ii) there is nonetheless a preference for agreement with the structurally lower subject, and (iii) \$\textbackslash overline \{\textbackslash text\{A\}\}\$-scrambling of the object never feeds agreement. We develop a cyclic-Agree analysis that provides a principled explanation of these generalizations. Crucial to this explanation are that (i) search space is dynamic and interacts with movement, (ii) there is a preference for agreement with elements c-commanded by the head that hosts the probe (first-cycle Agree), and (iii) ɸ-probes project as part of the label, but not past the immediate projection line of the head.},

  abstract = {This article develops a general theory of selective opacity effects, configurations in which the same constituent is opaque for some operations but transparent for others. Classical observations of selective opacity lie in the realm of movement. Finite clauses, for instance, are opaque for A-movement but transparent for Ā-extraction, a pattern that generalizes beyond the A/Ā distinction. Using novel evidence from movement-agreement interactions in Hindi-Urdu, I argue that selective opacity also encompasses ϕ-agreement and I propose that the underlying constraint applies, not to movement itself, but to Agree. I develop the novel concept of horizons, which delimit search spaces in probe-specific ways by terminating search. They thereby prevent particular probes from searching into them, inducing selective opacity. The horizons account derives an otherwise surprising property of selective opacity effects noted previously: the higher the structural position of a probe in the clausal spine, the more structures are transparent to it. The analysis proposed here unifies improper movement and related selective opacity restrictions, mismatches in the locality of movement and agreement, and intricate interactions between movement types and agreement.},

We propose that whole-entity classifier predicates are intransitive unaccusative, and that body-part classifier predicates are optionally transitive. Contrary to previous research on other sign languages, we argue that handling classifier predicates in RSL describe complex events with two subevents: one of handling, and one of movement, which are not necessarily causally connected. We further suggest that the ‘moving legs’ classifier predicate in RSL also describes a complex event consisting of two subevents. To account for these facts, we develop a formal analysis of classifier predicates in RSL. Specifically, we argue that whole-entity and body-part classifier handshapes are agreement markers, while handling classifier handshapes as well as the ‘moving legs’ classifier handshape represent an argument in combination with a verbal root. This casts doubt on the observation made in the literature that classifiers straightforwardly determine the argument structure of classifier predicates, since different classifiers in RSL represent different grammatical phenomena. In addition, we show that event structures associated with some classifier predicates are more complex than those associated with monoclausal structures in spoken languages.},

  abstract = {The mismatch between phonological and phonetic representationsThe division of the stream of speech into a string of discrete segments represents the number of places where contrast between the current speech event and others is possible. Discrete segments may be employed not only to represent phonological contrasts in speech events, however, but also in the plans for actually uttering them. Beyond isomorphism with phonological representations, the appropriateness of discrete segments at some level in the plans speakers employ to produce utterances is demonstrated by the fact that the vast majority of speech errors reorder entire segments rather than parts of segments or features (Shattuck- Hufnagel and Klatt 1979). This speech error evidence does not, however, reveal whether a segment-sized unit is employed at all levels in the plan for producing an utterance, nor what principles govern the coordination of articulators.Since more than one articulator is moving or otherwise active at any point in time in a speech event, the notion of a segment implies a specification for how these independent movements are coordinated. However, articulatory records of speech events cannot be divided into discrete intervals in which all movement of articulators for each segment begins and ends at the same time, nor can these records be obtained by a simple mapping from discrete underlying phonological segments. The continuous and coarticulatory properties of actual speech events instead make it very unlikely that the plans for producing them consist of nothing more than a string of discrete segments (Ohman 1966, 1967; Fowler 1980; Browman and Goldstein 1985, 1986; but cf. Henke 1966; Keating 1985).},

  abstract = {Listeners tend to categorize an ambiguous speech sound so that it forms a word with its context (Ganong, 1980). This effect could reflect feedback from the lexicon to phonemic activation (McClelland \& Elman, 1986), or the operation of a task-specific phonemic decision system (Norris, McQueen, \& Cutler, 2000). Because the former account involves feedback between lexical and phonemic levels, it predicts that the lexicon’s influence on phonemic decisions should be delayed and should gradually increase in strength. Previous response time experiments have not delivered a clear verdict as to whether this is the case, however. In 2 experiments, listeners’ eye movements were tracked as they categorized phonemes using visually displayed response options. Lexically relevant information in the signal, the timing of which was confirmed by separate gating experiments, immediately increased eye movements toward the lexically supported response. This effect on eye movements then diminished over the course of the trial rather than continuing to increase. These results challenge the lexical feedback account. The present work also introduces a novel method for analyzing data from ‘visual-world’ type tasks, designed to assess when an experimental manipulation influences the probability of an eye movement toward the target.},

  abstract = {Several fixed classification experiments test the hypothesis that F1, f0, and closure voicing covary between intervocalic stops contrasting for [voice] because they integrate perceptually. The perceptual property produced by the integration of these acoustic properties was at first predicted to be the presence of low-frequency energy in the vicinity of the stop, which is considerable in [+voice] stops but slight in [Àvoice] stops. Both F1 and f0 at the edges of vowels flanking the stop were found to integrate perceptually with the continuation of voicing into the stop, but not to integrate with one another. These results indicate that the perceptually relevant property is instead the continuation of low-frequency energy across the vowel-consonant border and not merely the amount of low-frequency energy present near the stop. Other experiments establish that neither F1 nor f0 at vowel edge integrate perceptually with closure duration, which shows that only auditorily similar properties integrate and not any two properties that reliably covary. Finally, the experiments show that these acoustic properties integrate perceptually (or fail to) in the same way in non-speech analogues as in the original speech. This result indicates that integration arises from the auditory similarity of certain acoustic correlates of the [voice] contrast. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The study investigates whether a vowel length contrast is developing before fortis stops due to dialect leveling. We measured vowel and consonant duration in trochaic words differing only in vowel length which were read by 40 older and younger Bavarian and Saxon (control group) German speakers. Older Bavarians distinguished tense and lax vowels by means of vowel to vowel plus consonant ratios that indicate an inverse timing pattern. Saxons and younger Bavarians signal the tense–lax distinction independently of the following stop length. A perception test showed that this sound change in progress also affects perception. We argue for a contact-induced change which is triggered by external as opposed to internal factors.},

A primary aim was to determine whether acoustic cues that were available for the stop voicing distinction were perceptible in a neutralizing context. A secondary aim was to assess whether voicing perception was influenced by phonotactic frequency and the potential for resyllabification. Nineteen listeners of a Standard German speaking variety made forced-choice judgments to synthetic stimuli spanning a voiced–voiceless continuum containing domain-final alveolar and velar stops in various neutralizing contexts that differed in terms of phonotactic probability and the potential for resyllabification. Our results showed that voicing information could be distinguished but that the perceptibility of this distinction also depended on statistical properties of phoneme sequences and whether a domain-final stop could potentially be perceptually resyllabified as domain-initial. Our general conclusion is that a categorical neutralization model is insufficient to account for stop voicing perception in German in a domain-final context: instead, voicing perceptibility in these contexts depends on an interaction between acoustic information and phonological knowledge which emerges as a generalization across the lexicon.},

Calligraphic terminology was borrowed to identify and analyze the anatomical pieces of Cherokee graphemes. Previous scholars have explored the Cherokee Syllabary in-depth, but did not apply a systematic formal and structural analysis to the sign inventory. Through my analysis, I observe that 1) MCS (Modern Cherokee Syllabary) is a syllabic system, 2) OCS (Original Cherokee Syllabary) may have features of a mixed system with abugida-like diacritics, 3) OCS and MCS graphemes are formally related, 4) approximately 50\% of the possible diacritics in OCS were maintained into MCS graphemes, and 5) many CS graphemes were borrowed and repurposed from the Roman alphabet, resulting in graphemic divergence through the alterations of rotation, deletion, and substitution.},

Chapters are divided into five thematic areas: segmental production, prosodic production, measuring speech, audition and perception, and applications of phonetics. Each chapter presents an historical overview of the area, along with critical issues, current research and advice on the best practice for teaching phonetics to undergraduates. It brings together global perspectives, and includes examples from a wide range of languages, allowing readers to extend their knowledge beyond English. By providing both state-of-the-art research information, and an appreciation of how it can be shared with students, this handbook is essential both for academic phoneticians, and anyone with an interest in this exciting, rapidly developing field.},

This is done by reviewing the methods of electroglottography, endoscopy, photoglottography, and measurements of airflow and air pressure. The article further examines magnetic resonance imaging and radiography (X-rays)—the methods employed to investigate the entire vocal tract. The review is concluded with the methods of video recording and optical tracking, as used to study manual gestures in speech and sign language. Each methodological section contains a review of relevant journal publications illustrating the application of the method, as well as references to further readings.

The hypothesis holds that the maintenance of the contrast should correspond to more acoustic information in the signal and higher identification rate, and that its neutralization should be accompanied by fewer cues and lower recognition of the segments. The results of acoustic and perceptual experiments do not fully support the hypothesis: while the relative acoustic and perceptual salience of the contrast before three consonants (\_\#k, \_\#n, \_\#s) correlates with within-word neutralization patterns, the lack of neutralization after three vowels (a\_, u\_, and i\_) does not follow from the acoustic and perceptual results. The findings suggest that acoustic and perceptual factors play a certain role in maintenance and neutralization of phonological contrasts; however, the mapping between acoustics and phonology is not direct.},

  abstract = {The Classical Latin verb has featured prominently in theoretical morphology. In particular, the notoriously unpredictable forms of the past participles that nevertheless show reliable syncretism with a semantically diverse set of deverbals challenge our notions about the relationship between form and meaning. The various treatments of this system disagree not only in their theoretical building blocks but also in their basic assumptions about what ought to be explained, which makes it difficult to properly evaluate them against one another. This paper aims to empirically motivate the prior assumptions about productivity and arbitrariness that drive these accounts. In applying insights developed for child language acquisition to a large Latin corpus, the theoretical frameworks are compared on equal footing. It becomes clear that the productive past participle forms do not line up well with the frequency-based assumptions of prior accounts and instead mirror the diachronic developments that the system underwent on its path to Romance. A new treatment is proposed to incorporate the acquisition results and to conform with diachronic outcomes. The methods developed here reveal explanatory gaps in the theories that had not previously been appreciated and emphasize the importance of quantitative evidence from a range of sources in future morphological analysis.},

In this article, experimental studies on this phenomenon are reviewed with these two questions in mind: is the phenomenon a phonological process at all and is this predictable information, i.e. vowel nasalisation, stored in the mental lexicon. The majority of studies provide evidence supporting the phonological view and underspecified lexical representations.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Many researchers have studied the acoustics, physiology, and perceptual characteristics of the voice source, but despite significant attention, it remains unclear which aspects of the source should be quantified and how measurements should be made. In this study, the authors examined the relationships among a number of existing measures of the glottal source spectrum, along with the association of these measures to overall spectral shapes and to glottal pulse shapes, to determine which measures of the source best capture information about the shapes of glottal pulses and glottal source spectra. Method: Seventy-eight different measures of source spectral shapes were made on the voices of 70 speakers. Principal components analysis was applied to measurement data, and the resulting factors were compared with factors similarly derived from oral speech spectra and glottal pulses. Results: Results revealed high levels of duplication and overlap among existing measures of source spectral slope. Further, existing measures were not well aligned with patterns of spectral variability. In particular, existing spectral measures do not appear to model the higher frequency parts of the source spectrum adequately. Conclusion: The failure of existing measures to adequately quantify spectral variability may explain why results of studies examining the perceptual importance of spectral slope have not produced consistent results. Because variability in the speech signal is often perceptually salient, these results suggest that most existing measures of source spectral slope are unlikely to be good predictors of voice quality.},

This study investigates the tonal dispersion of a multiple-level tone system by exploring the cues used in producing and perceiving the five level tones of Black Miao. Both production and perception experiments show that non-modal phonations are very important cues for these tonal contrasts. Non-modal phonations significantly contribute to the dispersion of the five level tones in two ways: either by enhancing pitch contrasts or by providing an additional contrastive cue. Benefiting from more than one cue, the level tones T11, T33 and T55 are well distinguished in the tonal space; by contrast, the level tones T22 and T44, only contrasting in pitch, are the most confusable tones. The tonal registers model proposed in this article sheds light on the different uses of non-modal phonations across languages.},

It consists of fifteen chapters, some of which look at word prosody and phrase prosody in individual languages, some examine the interactions between lexical tones and intonation, and others analyze the syntax-prosody interface. Despite much recent attention paid to prosody, there is yet a significant number of languages and dialects that remain largely undocumented or understudied. Many chapters in this volume contribute to this empirical gap in prosodic research by presenting new data, based on original fieldwork and experiments. Moreover, many chapters address important questions pertaining to the interactions between lexical and postlexical tones with in-depth investigations of both lexical prosody and postlexical phonology. Furthermore, other chapters tackle the question of how prosodic structure-either lexical or postlexical-interacts with syntactic structure, thereby contributing to our understanding of the interaction between multiple components of the grammar, embedded in a thorough understanding of current linguistic theories. The volume as a whole addresses many difficult issues and illuminates the question of how prosody is structured in language and functions in human communication"--},

  abstract = {Mainland Scandinavian languages have been reported to allow movement from embedded questions, relative clauses, and complex NPs—domains commonly considered to be islands crosslinguistically. Yet in formal acceptability studies Scandinavian participants often show 'island effects': they reject island-violating movement similarly to native speakers of 'island-sensitive' languages. To investigate this apparent mismatch between informal and formal judgments, we conducted two acceptability judgment experiments testing the acceptability of topicalization from various island domains in Norwegian. We were interested in determining whether we could (i) find evidence for island insensitivity and (ii) pin down the source of qualitatively different island effects. We asked whether such effects are best explained as reflecting violations of a uniform syntactic constraint or extrasyntactic factors. Our results suggest that embedded questions and relative clauses are not uniform syntactic islands for topicalization, but complex NPs are. Unexpectedly, we also found evidence suggesting that conditional adjunct clauses may not be islands.*},

It discusses whether or not natural language employs a temporal system that explicitly quantifies over times at the level where semantic interpretation takes place. I first argue that a single-index theory is not empirically adequate for natural language. I then propose a system in which times are syntactically represented. The system works in such a way that tense morphemes saturate the time argument slots of the predicates they attach to. Consequently it predicts that only the times of the main tensed predicates of clauses are accessible. Empirical evidence is presented showing such a distinction between tenseless and tensed predicates in terms of the accessibility to the times introduced by them.},

The principle as recognized by the Neogrammarian linguists states that once a sound change has begun, it affects every word in the vocabulary that contains the sound in question. The principle has been disputed by many linguists and especially dialectologists, who argue that 'every word has its own history'. This article demonstrates how the Neogrammarian principle operates in one prototypical change in progress, the raising of the mid front long vowel /ey/ before a consonant in Philadelphia English. Mixed-level regression analysis shows consistent phonetic constraints across the nineteenth century, with no effect of word frequency. The regularity of sound change is reflected in the common pattern of behavior of the most frequent words, those of moderate frequency, and words that occur only once in the corpus.*},

  abstract = {This chapter sets out several basic ideas of what I will refer to as the autosegmental–metrical (AM) theory of intonational phonology. The somewhat cumbersome name reflects the intellectual heritage of the theory in American non-linear ‘autosegmental’ and ‘metrical’ phonology of the 1970s, but it also embodies certain ideas about intonational structure that I will develop in chapters 7 and 8. The general approach has its origins in three influential PhD theses, namely Liberman (1975), Bruce (1977), and – especially – Pierrehumbert (1980). During the 1980s the theory was applied to a variety of European languages (e.g. Ladd 1983a; Gussenhoven 1984) and served as the basis of a number of systems for synthesising intonation by rule (e.g. Pierrehumbert 1981; Anderson, Pierrehumbert, and Liberman 1984; Ladd 1987b). It was central in the development of ‘laboratory phonology’ (Beckman and Kingston 1990; Pierrehumbert, Beckman and Ladd 2000), in that it very early adopted the goal of explaining details of instrumentally measured F0in a phonological description; it takes for granted that instrumental phonetics is a source of data for phonological theory. Since the early 1990s, it has given rise to a whole series of ToBI (Tone and Break Index) transcription systems for the intonation of a variety of languages, and on this basis it is widely presupposed in discussions of prosodic structure and of the relation between intonation and information structure.},

  abstract = {We have now seen in some detail how the AM theory provides a useful descriptive framework that has been successfully applied to many languages, and how it gives us the potential to make more specific and hence more testable statements about intonational universals. To the extent that we discussed disagreements about the appropriate analysis of specific contour types, the discussion was framed in the context of cross-language comparison: we argued that certain analyses are more appropriate than others in view of the goal of linguistic typology. However, many of the disagreements actually depend on unresolved theoretical issues within intonational phonology itself, questions that are relevant whether we are comparing cross-linguistically or trying to describe a single variety of a single language. These are the topic of this chapter.Issues in tonal descriptionNuclear and prenuclear accentsWe begin with an issue that lies at the boundary between ‘pitch’ and ‘prominence’ (the two aspects of intonation sketched in figure 1.1), namely the distinction between ‘nuclear’ and other kinds of accents. This distinction, in one form or another, has been a part of theorising about intonational structure at least since the beginning of the British tradition. (See Cruttenden 1992b for an interesting discussion of pre-twentieth-century precursors to the nucleus idea.) According to the founding work in the British school (Palmer 1922), an intonation contour is divided into three parts, called head, nucleus, and tail.},

Through a logical structure that introduces and builds upon key concepts in a gradual way and slowly acclimatizes students to using R and Stan software, the book covers: An introduction to probability and Bayesian inference, Understanding Bayes' rule, Nuts and bolts of Bayesian analytic methods, Computational Bayes and real-world Bayesian analysis, Regression analysis and hierarchical methods. This unique guide will help students develop the statistical confidence and skills to put the Bayesian formula into practice, from the basic concepts of statistical inference to complex applications of analyses." --},

Such is the case in Hebrew V(P)-fronting, where the fronted verb surfaces as an infinitive, and its ÔÔtraceÕÕ is pronounced as an inflected verbal copy. This paper argues that V-doubling is explained by the same algorithm that determines pronunciation of single copies in canonical chains. The phonetic resolution of chains is PF-internal, strictly local, and need not appeal to cross-interface recoverability constraints. Crosslinguistic variation in predicate clefts largely reflects different morpho-phonological strategies of realizing the fronted predicate head.},

  abstract = {There is considerable controversy over the factors that shape infants’ developing knowledge of grammar. Work with artificial languages suggests that infants’ ability to track statistical regularities within the speech they hear could, in principle, support grammatical development. However, little work has tested whether infants’ performance on laboratory tasks reflects factors that are relevant in real-world language learning. Here we tested whether the language that infants hear at home, and their receptive language skills, predict their performance on tasks assessing the ability to learn non-adjacent statistical dependencies (NADs) at 15 months, and whether that in turn predicts sensitivity to native-language NADs at 18 months. We found evidence for some (though not all) of these relations, and primarily for females. The results suggest that performance on the artificial language-learning task reveals something about the mechanisms of grammatical development, and that females and males may be learning NADs differently.},

In this paper we sketch the AP Linguistics initiative, describing the potential benefits of linguistics for American high schools and their students, the attractions of high school linguistics for the field of Linguistics itself, the motivations for an AP Linguistics course in this context, the formal requirements of an AP Linguistics proposal to the College Board, and the steps being taken to meet those requirements.*},

(i. a) John [VP destroy the evidence] “Pure VP”; (i. b) John -’s [NP destroying the evidence] Nominalized VP; (i. c) John -’s [NP destroying of the evidence] Nominalized V; (i. d) John -’s [NP destruction of the evidence] Deverbal N; (ii. a) NP [PP P1 NP] “Pure PP”; (ii. b) NP -Ez [NP P2 NP] Nominalized PP; (ii. c) NP -Ez [NP P2 -Ez NP] Nominalized P; (ii. d) NP -Ez [NP P3 -Ez NP] “Deprepositional” N. The notion “nominalization” is thus shown to be relevant to both of the lexical categories - V and P - identified by Chomsky (1974) as [-N]. Our demonstration proceeds in three steps: 1) We establish a common syntactic function for English -’s/of and iPersian -EZ, viz., case-assignment, following Samiian 1994; Karimi and Brame 1986/2012; Larson and Samiian 2020; 2) We argue for a shared cross-categorial structure for VP-PP, developing proposals by Jackendoff 1973; van Riemsdijk 1990; Svenonius 2003. We show that if Jackendoff’s (1977) “scopal nominalization” analysis of gerunds is extended to iPersian PPs, the parallelism in (i) and (ii) is accounted for; 3) We show that the full extension of nominalization to iPersian PPs suggests a more general view of nominalization than has been recognized previously, viz., a “split-feature” view of category specification. This has a variety of implications, which we briefly explore.},

For this reason, the Zapotec languages have been claimed to be among those in which condition C is not operational. This paper shows, however, that bound names in SLQZ do not constitute condition C violations. Rather, they are anaphoric variables spelled out as copies of their antecedents. Evidence for this proposal comes from the fact that bound copies are interpreted as bound variables in VP-deletion contexts and from the fact that strong crossover effects hold robustly in the language, showing that condition C is operational. This paper also shows that identical facts hold in Thai, another language thought to lack condition C.},

  abstract = {This is a comprehensive description of a language spoken some 450 km offshore from the mainland of Papua New Guinea. The language is remarkable for its phonological, morphological and syntactic complexity. As the sole surviving member of its language family, and with little historical contact with surrounding languages, the language provides evidence of the kind of languages spoken in this part of the world before the Austronesian expansion. The grammar provides detailed information on the phoneme inventory, morphology, syntax and select semantic fields. Remarkable features include a 90 phoneme inventory including unique sounds, a morphology with thousands of non-compositional portmanteau elements, complex rules for negation, and extensive ergative syntax. Unusual patterns are also found in the organization of semantic fields, for example in partonymies of the body, taxonomies of the natural world, verbal semantics and kinship terms. The combination of linguistic ‘rara’ suggest that linguistic evolution under low contact can yield baroque and unusual patterns. The volume should be of special interest to linguists, typologists, sociolinguists, anthropologists and researchers in Oceania and Melanesia. Endorsement: "This long-awaited grammar is a major contribution to Papuan and general linguistics, providing as it does by far the most comprehensive and accurate grammatical description of a language that has already assumed a position as one of the world's most complicated. Hitherto, the most extensive grammatical description of the language has been the survey-like Henderson (1995), and while Levinson explicitly acknowledges his debt to this earlier grammar and to unpublished work by Henderson, his own detailed grammar clearly takes the level of description and analysis of the language to a completely new level. In particular, Levinson's grammar makes clear precisely to what extent and in what ways the language's morphology is complex beyond even what most studies on morphologically complex languages envisage. In addition, it provides a much more detailed account of the language's syntax, based on a judicious combination of corpus attestation and careful elicitation (incl. using the kits developed by Levinson's group at the MPI for Psycholinguistics). The grammar thus not only fills a major lacuna in our knowledge of the non-Austronesian languages of the New Guinea area, but also provides grist for future studies on the implications of the language's complexities."

  abstract = {Tianjin Mandarin is a member of the northern Mandarin Chinese family (ISO 693-3: [cmn]). It is spoken in the urban areas of the Tianjin Municipality (CN-12) in the People's Republic of China, which is about 120 kilometers to the southeast of Beijing. Existing studies on Tianjin Mandarin have focused mainly on its tonal aspects, especially its intriguing tone sandhi system, with few studies examining the segmental aspects (on tone, see e.g. Li \& Liu 1985, Shi 1986, Liu 1993, Lu 1997, Wang \& Jiang 1997, Chen 2000, Liu \& Gao 2003, Ma 2005, Ma \& Jia 2006, Zhang \& Liu 2011, Li \& Chen 2016; on segmental aspects, see e.g. Han 1993a, b; Wee, Yan \& Chen 2005). As also noted in Wee et al. (2005), this is probably due to the similarity in segmental structures between Tianjin Mandarin and Standard Chinese, especially among speakers of the younger generation, and what differentiates the two Mandarin varieties is most notably their tonal systems. The aim of the present description is therefore to provide a systematic phonetic description of both segmental and tonal aspects of Tianjin Mandarin, with main focus on the tonal aspects.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a set of constraints within the framework of Optimality Theory that accounts for syllable-final laryngeal neutralization and voicing assimilation in obstruent clusters. The interaction of positional faithfulness and markedness is shown to result in laryngeal neutralization. Regressive assimilation is shown to be a result of the interaction of positional faithfulness with a constraint preferring adjacent obstruents to agree in voicing. Rerankings of the proposed constraints account for attested patterns of voicing assimilation and neutralization: unlike previous neutralization and spread analyses, this approach makes the correct prediction that it is equally natural for voicing assimilation in clusters to combine with either devoicing of or retention of voicing distinctions in word-final consonants. It is argued that the interactions of these constraints account for why voicing assimilation is always regressive unless special circumstances hold.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) are being increasingly widely used in psychology to analyse multi-level research designs. This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher’s theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.’s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.},

I argue that of the three syntactic criteria called upon in the definition of syntactic categories within this approach, only one, the internal syntactic structure of a phrase, is a sufficient criterion for syntactic categorization.

One aspect of the controversy concerns the similarities between the units of segmental phonology and those of alphabetic writing: the historically and culturally contingent fact that Western society uses alphabetic writing may explain the primacy of segments in modern phonology. The ancient Indian tradition of phonological analysis has been claimed to exemplify a nonsegmental approach, reflecting their lack of influence from alphabetic writing. I show that the ancient Indian phonological tradition was fundamentally segmental, despite lacking any alphabetic influence. In ancient India, segmental units were identified as the basic units of analysis on the basis of purely linguistic considerations.*},

The child-specific patterns are often assumed to be low-level phonetic effects, and so, in a classical modular feedforward grammar, they should not interfere with the higher-level adult-based phonology. This paper reports an interaction in which the application of a categorical adult-based process (Voice Assimilation) is conditioned by a gradient child-specific process (fricative devoicing). Acoustic analyses of longitudinal data from a Polish-speaking child reveal variable Voice Assimilation effects in target voiced fricative–stop/stop–fricative clusters (voicing and devoicing), correlated with the extent of voicing in fricatives in non-assimilatory contexts. I analyse this phonology–phonetics trade-off by appealing to symbol-like dynamical representations, expressed in the language of non-linear mathematics. Such representations offer a non-derivational link between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of speech. Variability ensues as a natural consequence of grammar change.},

Direct observations, parent questionnaires, and standardized tests were administered in 45 children at ages 1;0, 2;0, 3;0, and 4;0. Results show that both walk onset and early index-finger pointing predict language abilities at age 2;0, but only early index-finger pointing predicts language skills at ages 3;0 and 4;0. Walk onset seems to contribute to an initial increase in language acquisition without a sustained advantage. The predictive value of first observed index-finger points, however, is strong and lasts at least until age 4;0.},

It outlines work done on the nature of definiteness in semantics, pragmatics and syntax, and develops an account on which definiteness is a grammatical category represented in syntax as a functional head (the widely discussed D). Consideration is also given to the origins and evolution of definite articles in the light of the comparative and theoretical findings.

  abstract = {Summary The paper proposes a novel structural analysis of Hittite determinate relative clauses on the basis of a corpus study considering a wider and fuller array of Hittite data than ever before. In Hittite, relative wh-phrases attest a wide range of linear positions: first/initial, clause-second, immediately preverbal or even postverbal. We build upon the current assumption that wh-pronouns are clitics and thus their placement is determined by the syntax-prosody interface. As for the syntactic component, we argue against the in situ construal of wh-elements. Instead, we propose that what linearly appears to be clause-second, preverbal or postverbal position of the wh-pronoun is structurally associated with Spec, FinP. The prosodic component is provided by the standardly acknowledged prosodic inversion, but the prosodic domain for the placement of wh-clitics is not clausal (CP), it is rather to be identified with a smaller domain within CP, namely, FinP. We also provide the first ever systematic treatment of split wh-phrases which are highly problematic for existing approaches but are fully accounted for by our analysis.},

There are two major sets of Kumiai varieties: Northern Kumiai (Ipai/’Iipay) and Southern Kumiai (Tipai/Tiipay) (Golla 2011). A third cluster of varieties, located in southeastern San Diego County, is proposed in Langdon (1991) and Miller (2001). The speech illustrated below is representative of Ja’a, a Southern Kumiai dialect spoken in Juntas de Nejí, Baja California, Mexico (see Figure 1 below). There are currently only four fluent speakers of Ja’a Kumiai (Miller 2016b). Recordings were made over a six-month period with a 48-year-old female speaker born and raised in Juntas de Nejí. Quantitative data reported in this paper are taken from a subset of the current corpus, from recordings made with the speaker in a soundproof booth. Only the speech of this single speaker is reported here given the severe endangerment of the language.},

  abstract = {Recent research has revealed several languages (e.g. Chintang, Rarámuri, Tagalog, Murrinhpatha) that challenge the general expectation of strict sequential ordering in morphological structure. However, it has remained unclear whether these languages exhibit random placement of affixes or whether there are some underlying probabilistic principles that predict their placement. Here we address this question for verbal agreement markers and hypothesize a probabilistic universal of category clustering, with two effects: (i) markers in paradigmatic opposition tend to be placed in the same morphological position (‘paradigmatic alignment’; Crysmann \& Bonami 2016); (ii) morphological positions tend to be categorically uniform (‘featural coherence’; Stump 2001). We first show in a corpus study that category clustering drives the distribution of agreement prefixes in speakers’ production of Chintang, a language where prefix placement is not constrained by any categorical rules of sequential ordering. We then show in a typological study that the same principle also shapes the evolution of morphological structure: although exceptions are attested, paradigms are much more likely to obey rather than to violate the principle. Category clustering is therefore a good candidate for a universal force shaping the structure and use of language, potentially due to benefits in processing and learning.*},

At the lexical level, we present the different formational strategies used to generate cardinal numerals and we provide evidence that in the younger generations of signers, the sign one has lost the function of indefinite determiner and is now used as a cardinal only. At the syntactic level, we show that the attested variation in the ordering between the cardinal and the noun is in part due to definiteness and contrastive focus. We account for this variation within the cartographic approach to syntax. Finally, we offer a principled explanation for the reason why cardinals inside Measure Phrases are not subject to word order variation, but always precede the measure noun.},

This contrasts with classical approaches treating the head status of clitics as derived from a fundamentally phrasal syntax. We show that different structures of merger for clitics and phrasal arguments (including full pronouns) can explain well-known empirical differences that otherwise need to be stipulated or derived via extra-syntactic—viz. morphological—mechanisms. This view of cliticization seems to run into immediate problems once we move away from object clitics in finite declarative sentences in Italian or French and tackle slightly less familiar linguistic systems that allow interpolation, enclisis (inversion), and allow clitic sequences to split (object vs. subject clitics). We argue that the above phenomena receive a principled explanation under the assumption that clitics are pair merged with different phase heads.},

Modern English glosses for every prose-passage and poem are provided on the same page as the text, along with extensive notes. A succinct reference grammar is appended, along with guides to pronunciation and to grammatical terminology. A comprehensive glossary lists and analyses all the Old English words that occur in the book. Headnotes to each of the six text sections, and to every individual text, establish their literary and historical contexts, and illustrate the rich cultural variety of Anglo-Saxon England.

If no ordering is established, allomorphic choice is determined by the phonology—in particular, by the emergence of the unmarked (TETU). In other cases, TETU effects are insufficient, and lexical ordering determines the preference for dominant allomorphs.},

It can be regarded as a ‘missing link’ in tonogenesis: following the loss of voicing contrasts on syllableinitial consonants, Tamang has four tonal categories instead of its earlier two-tone system; the present state of the prosodic system is typologically transitional, in that these four tonal categories are realised by several cues which include fundamental frequency (F0), phonation type, and allophonic variation in the realisation of consonants. Acoustic and electroglottographic recordings of 131 words in two carrier sentences by 5 speakers were conducted (total number of target syllables analysed: n = 1,651). They allow for a description in terms of F0, glottal open quotient, duration, and realisation of consonants. The results confirm the diversity of cues to the four tonal categories, and show evidence of laxness on tones 3 and 4, i.e. on the two tones which originate diachronically in voiced initials. The discussion hinges on the phonological definition of tone.},

  institution = {{University of Utah}},
  abstract = {Harmonic Serialism (HS) is a constraint based theory of phonology that has gained interest in the last ten years. As a theory of phonology, HS must be able to account for phonologically conditioned allomorphy. Currently in HS, phonologically conditioned allomorphy is analyzed in one of two ways – either using a single underlying representation in HS or through the realizational framework of Optimal Interleaving (known as Harmonic Serialism with Optimal Interleaving (HS/OI)). Yet, using data from Jersey Norman French (Jèrriais), I show that neither approach can account for certain cases of phonologically conditioned allomorphy. To remedy this deficiency, I propose the inclusion of Lexical Selection (LS) in HS in a framework termed Harmonic Serialism with Lexical Selection (HS/LS). LS provides for the lexical listing of allomorphs and, when needed, the ordering of allomorphs in the input to reflect a grammar's preference to use certain allomorphs regardless of surface markedness. Using data from Jèrriais, Dyirbal, Moroccan Arabic, Polish, and Catalan I develop a full theory of HS/LS. I explore how GEN is conceived of in HS, how allomorph selection functions within the theory, and how HS/LS can handle certain cases of opacity. I propose a revision of the constraint PRIORITY, which is the LS constraint responsible for ensuring respect of allomorph ordering, from a gradient faithfulness constraint to a categorical markedness constraint. The incorporation of LS into HS is important in that it allows HS to more fully account for phonologically conditioned allomorphy.},

We discuss implications for the complexity of phonology and for the relationship between the explanation of typology and the evaluation of phonological theories.},

  abstract = {"A bestselling linguist takes us on a lively tour of how the English language is evolving before our eyes and why we should embrace this transformation and not fight it. Language is always changing -- but we tend not to like it. We understand that new words must be created for new things, but the way English is spoken today rubs many of us the wrong way. Whether its the use of literally to mean "figuratively" rather than "by the letter" or the way young people use LOL and like or business jargon like Whats the ask? it often seems as if the language is deteriorating before our eyes. But the truth is different and a lot less scary, as John McWhorter shows in this delightful and eye-opening exploration of how English has always been in motion and continues to evolve today. Drawing examples from everyday life and employing a generous helping of humor, he shows that these shifts are a natural process common to all languages, and that we should embrace and appreciate these changes, not condemn them. Words on the Move opens our eyes to the surprising backstories to the words and expressions we use every day. Did you know that silly once meant "blessed?" Or that ought was the original past tense of owe? Or that the suffixly in adverbs is actually a remnant of the word like? And have you ever wondered why some people from New Orleans sound as if they come from Brooklyn? McWhorter encourages us to marvel at the dynamism and resilience of the English language, and his book offers a lively journey through which we discover that words are ever on the move and our lives are all the richer for it"--},

  abstract = {This chapter offers an explanation for the distribution of the Hawaiian particle ai. While ai has often been understood as a resumptive element in the generative literature, ai is not a pronoun and it does not have independent lexical features. The distribution of ai is such that it appears in any construction with an A-bar gap, excluding those involving local subject movement. Non-canonical word orders without ai are argued to not involve gaps, based on complementizer alternations. Given this distribution, ai is analyzed as a phonological repair for otherwise illicit linearization statements. Connecting ai to linearization explains how ai has the distribution of a resumptive pronoun despite not having lexical features. The similarities between resumption (for languages that have it) and the distribution of ai follow not from sharing the same mechanism, but from cross-linguistic properties which constrain the locality of syntactic operations.},

These include perhaps most prominently the sequence usually read as {$<$}harija{$>$} on the Skåäng stone where the Vimose comb preserves the expected form {$<$}harja{$>$}. Rather than assume that a Neogrammarian sound law is violated in a runic text, a more profitable approach is usually to assume that it is the interpretation that is at fault. Many of the instances where Sievers’ Law vocalizations seem to occur in an aberrant manner are texts that are better explained in manners other than have traditionally been accepted.},

I show how this analysis derives the key properties of de comparatives, including the fact that they are acceptable in a much more restricted set of environments than their que counterparts. The latter are argued to involve additional covert structure, which accounts for their general flexibility. If correct, these data point to a previously unnoticed locus of cross-linguistic variation in comparative formation, whereby a standard morpheme is subject to semantic as well as syntactic well-formedness conditions.},

A sequence of two high tones, for example, is avoided in a variety of ways: one of the tones is deleted or retracted away from the other, or the two are fused into a single high tone. Processes that would create such a sequence are blocked. The problem is how to derive all these different ways of avoiding this configuration from a single principle. It is argued here that Optimality Theory (OT) provides the means to derive the full range of dissimilatory effects from the OCP, through the ranking of the OCP with Faithfulness constraints. Examples of tonal dissimilation in three Bantu languages are examined: Shona, Rimi, and Kishambaa. The analysis supports the OT interpretation of constraints as violable and ranked.},

This paper examines lateral liquids, whose [continuant] specification has been the subject of controversy because of their ability to pattern both with continuants and with non-continuants, and because phonetically they are situated in the contested ground between two different articulatory definitions for the feature [continuant]. Evidence from a survey of sound patterns in 561 languages shows that lateral liquids, like nasals, pattern with continuants about as often as with non-continuants. Ambivalent phonological behaviour is argued to be natural and expected for phonetically ambiguous segments in a theory of emergent distinctive features where features are the result of sound patterns, rather than the other way around.},

The bulk of the extant Gothic corpus is a translation of the Bible, of which only a portion remains, and which has been the focus of most previous works. This book is the first in English to also draw on the recently discovered Bologna fragment and Crimean graffiti, original Gothic texts that provide more insights into the language. Following an overview of the history of the Goths and the origin of the Gothic language, Gary Miller explores all the major topics in Gothic grammar, beginning with the alphabet and phonology, and proceeding through subjects such as case functions, prepositions and particles, compounding, derivation, and verbal and sentential syntax. He also presents a selection of Gothic texts with notes and vocabulary, and ends with a chapter on linearization, including an overview of Gothic in its Germanic context. The Oxford Gothic Grammar will be an invaluable reference for all Indo-Europeanists, Germanic scholars, and historical linguists, from advanced undergraduate level upwards},

  abstract = {Click consonants are well known for lacking allophonic variation. This lack of variation has been attributed to the existence of articulatory constraints on the coronal constrictions that are imposed by the existence of a second dorsal constriction. The current study investigates temporal acoustic differences among the four contrastive coronal click types in the /i/ and /u/ contexts in Mangetti Dune !Xung. Clicks have been described as being either non-affricated or affricated. However, when vowel context is taken into consideration, the typology is more complex. The alveolar click is non-affricated in both vowel contexts. The dental and lateral clicks are fricated in both contexts. The palatal click in the /i/ context has two clear anterior and posterior transients, followed by palatal frication, while in the /u/ context it is non-affricated. Results are consistent with an analysis of the palatal click in the /i/ context as involving allophonic secondary palatalization. There are trading relations between the duration of the click burst, frication noise and aspiration noise phases. Results have implications for understanding the synchronic and diachronic phonology of click consonants.},

As 189 mothers interacted with each of their twins at age 0;5, we calculated the number of utterances, the proportion of sensitive utterances, and the proportion of self-repeated utterances they produced. We later assessed the twins’ language comprehension and production when they were 1;6, 2;6, and 5;2. Quantity of maternal speech predicted child language at 5;2, whereas sensitivity predicted child language at 2;6 and 5;2 and partial self-repetition predicted child language at 1;6. Conversely, sensitivity and partial self-repetition in maternal speech at 0;5 were associated with genetic factors from the child, indicating that infant characteristics influence the quality of maternal speech. Overall, our findings stress the importance of considering both directions in the association between maternal speech and child characteristics.},

A speech corpus containing groups of words differing only as to tone type and vowel quantity was designed. These were embedded in a short carrier sentence of five mid tone syllables, with the target word being the center syllable. The utterances were analyzed with respect to the tonal and segmental features of the target words and F0 contours modeled using the Fujisaki model. Analysis shows that all mid tone sequences can be modeled using the phrase component only whereas the remaining tones require either single tone commands of positive or negative polarity, or a command pair. Based on the analysis results, a perception experiment was designed to explore the perceptual space between words of tone/vowel quantity contrasts. Results indicate, inter alia, that vowel quantity is perceived as shorter when words are presented in isolation than when embedded in a carrier sentence. Confusions generally occur more frequently between words of different vowel quantity than of different tones.},

  abstract = {Purpose  Physiological and phonetic studies suggest that, at moderate levels of epilaryngeal stricture, the ventricular folds impinge upon the vocal folds and influence their dynamical behavior, which is thought to be responsible for constricted laryngeal sounds. In this work, the authors examine this hypothesis through biomechanical modeling. Method  The dynamical response of a low-dimensional, lumped-element model of the vocal folds under the influence of vocal–ventricular fold coupling was evaluated. The model was assessed for F0 and cover-mass phase difference. Case studies of simulations of different constricted phonation types and of glottal stop illustrate various additional aspects of model performance. Results  Simulated vocal–ventricular fold coupling lowers F0 and perturbs the mucosal wave. It also appears to reinforce irregular patterns of oscillation, and it can enhance laryngeal closure in glottal stop production. Conclusion  The effects of simulated vocal–ventricular fold coupling are consistent with sounds, such as creaky voice, harsh voice, and glottal stop, that have been observed to involve epilaryngeal stricture and apparent contact between the vocal folds and ventricular folds. This supports the view that vocal–ventricular fold coupling is important in the vibratory dynamics of such sounds and, furthermore, suggests that these sounds may intrinsically require epilaryngeal stricture.},

Two imaging modalities were used to study canonical phonetic productions anchored by auditory targets. Laryngeal posture was examined in axial and sagittal sections using magnetic resonance imaging, and high-speed laryngoscopic video was used to study posturing and vibratory dynamics. Together these data support the view that epilaryngeal constriction plays a key role in suppressing vocal fold vibration most directly through a vertical compaction mechanism, whereby the vocal folds and ventricular folds come into contact, obliterating the ventricle. The effect of this is suggested to increase mechanical impedance to mucosal wave transmission resulting in the perturbed vibration observed in creaky voice or facilitating vibratory arrest in glottal stop.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines a theoretical approach to speech sound systems based on the notion of phonological potentials: physical ‘pressures’ or biases that give rise to discrete structure and the tendencies associated with this structure that arise from the physical nature of speech sound systems. We apply this approach to a poorly understood area of phonology – phenomena of the lower vocal tract (LVT) – through a schematic that encapsulates the complex interactions among the vocal tract structures responsible for producing LVT sounds. With the framework, we provide an account of a range of LVT phenomena from several languages, illustrating how tonal, phonatory, and vowel qualities interact. Finally, we consider how the idea of phonological potentials extends across various physical domains and might exhibit patterns of alignment across these domains, thereby serving to guide the formation of patterns found in speech sound systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents both dictionary evidence and experimental evidence that the quality of a word's final vowel plays a role in assigning main stress in English. Specifically, a final [i] pushes main stress leftwards – three-syllable words ending with [i] have a strong tendency to take antepenultimate stress. This pattern is compared with the Latin Stress Rule for English, according to which words with heavy penultimate syllables should have penultimate stress. Both pressures are shown to be productive in experiments. Two analyses of the final-[i] generalisation are tested, one using the ‘cloned’ constraint Non-finFt[i], and one using the ‘parochial’ constraint Antepenult[i], which directly penalises [i]-final words which do not have antepenultimate stress. Although it is has less typological support, Antepenult[i] is argued for on the grounds that it correctly predicts participants' behaviour on words with both a heavy penult and a final [i], which are extremely rare in the lexicon.},

Sufficient data for assessing the nature of key formal traits exists, thanks to the more recent documentation of the sculptural corpus (Clark and Moreno 2007). After a review of the archaeological and historical linguistic context, the paper examines the history of research on the classification of the writing systems of Mesoamerica (Justeson 1986; Justeson and Mathews 1990; Justeson et al. 1985; Prem 1973), focusing on the Southeastern Tradition. Three diagnostic traits allow for a narrow assignation of Izapa's script, perhaps unsurprisingly, to the Greater Izapan or Maya-Izapa sub-tradition (Justeson and Mathews 1990; Justeson et al. 1985) of the Southeastern Tradition: the superfixed placement of the bar-and-dot numeral with respect to the day sign cartouche, positional notation for counting, and the use of day sign pedestals. Other traits include the conflation and embedding of signs. The paper concludes that the evidence is, at present, insufficient to distinguish between the two likely options, Mixe-Zoquean and Mayan. Finally, a preliminary signary is provided in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {IntroductionThe organization of segments within the syllable and across syllables is traditionally assumed to be driven by principles of sonority, a property that ranks segments along a scale from most sonorous to least sonorous. Although the nature of sonority itself is highly controversial, a fairly uncontroversial scale ranks stops, fricatives, nasals, liquids, glides, and vowels in order of increasing sonority, as shown in the scale in (1):(1) Stops \&lt; Fricatives \&lt; Nasals \&lt; Liquids \&lt; Glides \&lt; VowelsA number of cross-linguistic tendencies on the distribution and sequencing of segments is expressed with reference to sonority scales of the type in (1). In particular, the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) (Hooper 1976, Kiparsky 1979, Steriade 1982, Selkirk 1984, Clements 1990, Zec 1995, among others) states that in a syllable, the segment ranking highest on the sonority scale constitutes the syllable peak, with all other segments organized around it in such a way that the most sonorous segments are closer to the peak and the least sonorous ones are farthest away from it.A relatively significant number of languages show the phonotactic pattern in (2), whereby three basic types of consonant clusters occur in the onset.(2) a. Stop + Sonorant      b. Fricative + Sonorant      c. Fricative + Stop/(Fricative)},

Further, it shows that the renowned Swedish "lexical pitch accent" is not the result of lexical tones/tonemes.\&nbsp; Rather, Swedish is like all other languages and uses tones to mark the edges of prosodic constituents on the surface. "Accent 2" occurs when tones mark the edge of a structural uneven trochee (i.e. recursive foot) and "accent 1" occurs elsewhere. This analysis is counter all other treatments of North Germanic tones and denies the almost unquestioned assumption that there is an underlying tone specification on roots and/or affixes in many North Germanic varieties. At the same time, it unifies the intuitions behind the three previous approaches found in the literature.{$<$}!--EndFragment--{$>$}},

  abstract = {Within developmental psychology, pointing gestures have received a great deal of attention, while ostensive gestures have been overlooked in terms of their emergence and intentionality. In a longitudinal and micro-genetic study with six children at 9, 11, and 13 months of age, we codified gesture production of children within second-by-second data frames. We identified 480 instances of gestures and categorised whether they were of ostensive, ostensive–indexical, or indexical nature. We specified the communicative function of each gesture by analysing the object involved and their circumstances of production. Data analysis include frequencies, binomial tests, proportion comparisons, and repeated measures ANOVA. We identified a phatic function in other-directed gestures, as well as exploratory and private functions in self-directed gestures. This has important implications for child development since ostensive gestures are easier to produce and to understand than pointing. The consideration of objects would be essential for defining the communicative function of gestures.},

Much of typology can be explained equally well by either factor, making them hard to distinguish empirically. This study presents evidence that analytic bias is strong enough to create typological asymmetries in a case where channel bias is controlled. I show that (i) phonological dependencies between the height of two vowels are typologically more common than dependencies between vowel height and consonant voicing, (ii) the phonetic precursors of the height-height and height-voice patterns are equally robust and (iii) in two experiments, English speakers learned a height-height pattern and a voice-voice pattern better than a height-voice pattern. I conclude that both factors contribute to typology, and discuss hypotheses about their interaction.},

  abstract = {Hearing words in sentences facilitates word recognition in monolingual children. Many children grow up receiving input in multiple languages – including exposure to sentences that ‘mix’ the languages. We explored Spanish–English bilingual toddlers’ (n = 24) ability to identify familiar words in three conditions: (i) single word (ball!); (ii) same-language sentence (Where's the ball?); or (iii) mixed-language sentence (Dónde está la ball?). Children successfully identified words across conditions; however, the advantage linked to hearing words in sentences was present only in the same-language condition. This work hence suggests that language mixing plays an important role on bilingual children's ability to recognize spoken words.},

  abstract = {Scottish Gaelic displays a phonological contrast that is realised in different dialects by means of tonal accent, glottalisation or overlength. In line with existing analyses of similar oppositions in languages such as Swedish, Danish, Franconian and Estonian, I show that this contrast reflects a difference in metrical structure. Using the framework of Stratal Optimality Theory, I argue that this metrical contrast is derived, and results from faithfulness to foot structure that is built regularly at the stem level, but rendered opaque by subsequent phonological processes. Scottish Gaelic therefore represents an intermediate stage in the diachronic development of underlyingly contrastive metrical structure. This analysis successfully accounts for the complex properties of svarabhakti, a process of copy epenthesis that is intimately connected to the phonological contrast in question, and also sheds light upon the relationship between the oppositions of tonal accent, glottalisation and overlength found in various languages of northern Europe.},

  abstract = {Preaspiration (aspiration preceding the closure of a voiceless stop) is typologically rare (Laver 1994: 356) and, in the case of many languages and dialects in North West Europe, is noted as being an areal phenomenon. In some varieties preaspiration has been normalised in the phonology, whereas in others it occurs as a non-obligatory feature (Helgason 2002: 21- 23). The aim of this paper is to ascertain whether preaspiration is present in the repertoire of Welsh-English bilinguals in North Wales. Data was collected via word-list from four Welsh-English bilinguals and was analysed acoustically. Preaspiration was detected in 60.5\% of Welsh tokens and was also found, to a lesser extent, in the English tokens (33.3\%). As in previous studies, preaspiration is more common in female speech (78.3\%) than amongst males (57.7\%). The female informants, who were also more active users of the language, were significantly more prone to produce preaspirated English tokens.},

  abstract = {To assess a phonological theory, we often compare its predictions to phonetic observations. This can be complicated, however, because it requires a theoretical model that maps from phonological representations to articulatory and acoustic observations. In this study we are concerned with the question of how phonetic observations are interpreted in relation to phonological theories. Specifically, we argue that deviations of observations from theoretical predictions do not necessitate the rejection of the theoretical assumptions. We critically discuss the problem of overinterpretation of phonetic measures by using syllable coordination for different speaker groups within Articulatory Phonology. It is shown that surface variation can be explained without necessitating substantial revision of the underlying phonological theory. These results are discussed with respect to two types of interpretational errors in the literature. The first involves the proliferation of phonological categories in order to accommodate variation, and the second the rejection of a phonological theory because the model which generates its predictions is overly simplified.},

Fifty-three mother–child dyads (3;00–4;11) were video-recorded sharing two ostensibly similar picture-books: a simple story (containing no false belief) and a complex story (containing a false belief central to the plot, which provided content that was more challenging for preschoolers to understand). Book-reading interactions were transcribed and coded. Results showed that the complex stories facilitated more extra-textual talk from mothers, and a higher quality of extra-textual talk (as indexed by linguistic richness and level of abstraction). Although the type of story did not affect the number of questions mothers posed, more elaborative follow-ups on children's responses were provided by mothers when sharing complex stories. Complex stories may facilitate more and linguistically richer caregiver extra-textual talk, having implications for preschoolers’ developing language abilities.},

  abstract = {The present study provides an acoustic description of the vowel system of Santiago Mexquititlán Otomi (Hñäñho), an endangered and understudied Oto-Manguean language variety spoken in central Mexico. The goal of this production study was to determine whether the phonemic contrasts between Hñäñho vowels, as previously described impressionistically, are maintained in the acoustic realizations of a group of relatively balanced bilingual native speakers of Hñäñho or if Hñäñho phonemic categories are merging due to the extensive influence of Spanish. To this end, each Hñäñho speaker recorded a carefully designed list of 90 Hñäñho words and the resulting dataset of a total of 1507 tokens was subjected to analysis. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to predict Bark scale correlates of vowel height (B1 – b0) and vowel frontness/backness (B2 – B1) and the Pillai scores were calculated in order to determine the degree of overlap for adjacent Hñäñho vowel pairs. The speakers’ Hñäñho vowels were also compared to their Spanish vowels. A list of five Spanish words was used and a total of 90 tokens of the Spanish vowels were recorded. The results confirm that the vowel system of Hñäñho, produced by older Hñäñho speakers, consists of 10 distinct phonemes. Hñäñho-specific phonetic details are discussed, including the fronted realization of the vowel /u/ as [u̟] and the lowering of the vowel /ɔ/ to [ɒ], which might lead to a future /a – ɔ/ merger. These findings underline the importance of early and sustained exposure to indigenous bilinguals’ native language for the maintenance of phonetic features of Hñäñho despite extensive contact with Spanish.},

  publisher = {{Language Science Press}},
  abstract = {This book introduces formal grammar theories that play a role in current linguistic theorizing (Phrase Structure Grammar, Transformational Grammar/Government \& Binding, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, Categorial Grammar, Head-\hspace{0pt}Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Construction Grammar, Tree Adjoining Grammar). The key assumptions are explained and it is shown how the respective theory treats arguments and adjuncts, the active/passive alternation, local reorderings, verb placement, and fronting of constituents over long distances. The analyses are explained with German as the object language. The second part of the book compares these approaches with respect to their predictions regarding language acquisition and psycholinguistic plausibility. The nativism hypothesis, which assumes that humans posses genetically determined innate language-specific knowledge, is critically examined and alternative models of language acquisition are discussed. The second part then addresses controversial issues of current theory building such as the question of flat or binary branching structures being more appropriate, the question whether constructions should be treated on the phrasal or the lexical level, and the question whether abstract, non-visible entities should play a role in syntactic analyses. It is shown that the analyses suggested in the respective frameworks are often translatable into each other. The book closes with a chapter showing how properties common to all languages or to certain classes of languages can be captured. The book is a translation of the German book Grammatiktheorie, which was published by Stauffenburg in 2010. The following quotes are taken from reviews: With this critical yet fair reflection on various grammatical theories, Müller fills what was a major gap in the literature. Karen Lehmann, Zeitschrift für Rezen­sio­nen zur ger­man­is­tis­chen Sprach­wis­senschaft, 2012 Stefan Müller's recent introductory textbook, Gram­matik­the­o­rie, is an astonishingly comprehensive and insightful survey for beginning students of the present state of syntactic theory. Wolfgang Sternefeld und Frank Richter, Zeitschrift für Sprach­wissen­schaft, 2012 This is the kind of work that has been sought after for a while [...] The impartial and objective discussion offered by the author is particularly refreshing.

However, it is not clear if any instances of so-called homophony avoidance reported to date constitute an active synchronic restriction in the grammar. This paper presents an instance of homophony avoidance in Russian masculine nouns. A perception experiment shows that the trends observed in the corpus are only partially extended to nonce words. I argue that the asymmetry observed in the experimental results can only be attributed to a synchronic restriction against homophonous forms in the same paradigm. Thus this paper presents strong evidence in favour of a synchronic anti-homophony constraint.},

In this construction, the scope of a question phrase is extended by the presence of another word, the Q-marker, in a higher clause. While the syntax of this construction has been described and analysed in a number of works, its intonation is yet to receive commensurate attention. This paper presents data from two unrelated languages in which the Q-marking construction can be used to form questions: Hungarian and Slovenian. Data show that while the Q-marker shares properties with question words in Hungarian (they bear the same pitch accent), in Slovenian the Q-marker and question words bear distinct pitch accents. Furthermore, in Hungarian a direct intonational link exists between the Q-marker and a question phrase whose scope is extended, rather than an indirect one between the Q-marker and the entire lower clause in which the question phrase appears. The Slovenian data are compatible with the existence of either an indirect or a direct intonational link. These findings reveal hitherto unidentified dimensions of cross-linguistic variation, for which any analysis of the Q-marking construction must account.},

There is a phonetic basis for such                     restrictions at the ends of utterances, but not the ends of words. Historical                     linguists have long noted this mismatch, and have attributed it to an analogical                     generalisation of such restrictions from utterance-final to word-final position.                     To test whether language learners actually generalise in this way, two                     artificial language learning experiments were conducted. Participants heard                     nonsense utterances in which there was a restriction on utterance-final                     obstruents, but in which no information was available about word-final                     utterance-medial obstruents. They were then tested on utterances that included                     obstruents in both positions. They learned the pattern and generalised it to                     word-final utterance-medial position, confirming that learners are biased toward                     word-based distributional patterns.},

The separation of two types of tonal prominence,               big accents               versus               small accents               (previously called               focal               and               word accent               , e.g. Bruce 1977, 2007), is crucial for our analysis. The ω in Swedish needs to be structured on two levels, which we refer to as the minimal ω and the maximal ω, respectively. The minimal ω contains one stress, whereas the maximal ω contains one accent. We argue for a separate category φ that governs the distribution of big accents within clauses. The ι governs the distribution of clause-related edge phenomena like the               initiality accent               and right-edge boundary tones as well as the distribution of               nuclear big accents               .},

  abstract = {This article discusses the syntax–prosody interface, drawing on evidence from Stockholm Swedish. It is shown that a Swedish main clause containing an embedded clause has three prosodic correlates, two of which are non-isomorphic to the syntactic bracketing. However, two coordinated clauses have only one – isomorphic – prosodic correlate. Optimality-theoretic constraints (Prince \& Smolensky 1993) are used to derive this variation. A new markedness constraint, E               qual               S               isters               , is argued to be responsible for a preference for flat prosodic structures. This constraint requires that sister nodes in prosodic structure belong to the same prosodic category, and therefore sometimes conflicts with               match               constraints, which call for syntax–prosody correspondence (Selkirk 2009, 2011). When high-ranked, E               qual               S               isters               forces syntax–prosody non-isomorphism if the input syntactic structure contains embedding, whereas full isomorphism is predicted in coordinated structures. The previously suggested markedness constraints N               on-recursivity               and E               xhaustivity               (Selkirk 1996) cannot replace E               qual               S               isters               , and in the present account are rendered redundant.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to describe pre-aspirated and post-aspirated stops in an endangered language, Scottish Gaelic. Our small-scale study investigates several acoustic parameters of Scottish Gaelic stop consonants designed to measure the duration and noisiness of aspiration of the stop in its immediate phonetic context. Our study expands on previous phonetic descriptions of phonemic (pre-)aspiration in three ways: firstly, we provide a more complete durational description of Scottish Gaelic than previous work in the literature; secondly, we apply a new measure, band-pass filtered zero crossing rate (Gordeeva \& Scobbie 2010), in order to examine the noisiness of aspiration in addition to durational characteristics. The results from this measure are presented in tandem with durational results in order to assess its usefulness for future research. Thirdly, we consider the possibility of change in the Scottish Gaelic stop system by examining data from older and younger speakers. Results suggest that band-pass filtered zero crossing rate is a useful tool and should be considered in future research on aspiration. Also, durational and zero crossing results indicate that younger speakers have shorter and less noisy pre-aspiration than older speakers. We discuss these results as a possible sound change in progress.},

We argue that infants’ speech discrimination abilities are best viewed through a lens that considers both synchronic and diachronic aspects of the particular speech contrast. The key to this approach is the notion that acoustic–perceptual salience, or the relative separation of speech categories along perceptually relevant acoustic dimensions and corresponding discrimination performance in adults, is reflected in both infant's perceptual performance and patterns observed in phonological typology and history. The present review highlights challenges offered by four decades of literature, identifies broad patterns in infant vowel perception according to the acoustic properties of speech contrasts, and offers linguistically motivated explanations and directions for future research into the nature of young infants’ discrimination abilities.},

It tests this hypothesis first by scrutinizing each of the alleged Nordicisms in Beowulf, then by discussing various theoretical considerations bearing on its plausibility. We demonstrate that the syntactic, morphological, lexical, and semantic peculiarities that Frank would explain as manifestations of Old Norse influence are more economically and holistically explained as consequences of archaic composition. We then demonstrate that advances in the study of Anglo-Scandinavian language contact provide strong reasons to doubt that Old Norse could have influenced Beowulf in the manner that Frank has proposed. We conclude that Beowulf is entirely devoid of Old Norse influence and that it was probably composed ca. 700, long before the onset of the Viking Age.},

Chapters in the book all start from the assumption that structures at, above, and below the 'word' are built in the same derivational system: there is no lexicalist grammatical subsystem dedicated to word-building. This type of framework foregrounds the difficulty in defining wordhood. Questions such as whether there are restrictions on the size of structures that distinguish words from phrases, or whether there are combinatory operations that are specific to one or the other, are central to the debate. In this respect, chapters in the volume do not all agree. Some propose wordhood to be limited to entities defined by syntactic heads, while others propose that phrasal structure can be found within words. Some propose that head-movement and adjunction (and Morphological Merger, as its mirror image) are the manner in which words are built, while others propose that phrasal movements are crucial to determining the order of morphemes word-internally. 00All chapters point to the conclusion that the phonological domains that we call words are read off of the morphosyntactic structure in particular ways. It is the study of this interface, between the syntactic and phonological modules of Universal Grammar, that underpins the discussion in this volume},

Source parameters, F0, EE, UP, RG, OQ and RD were obtained by manual inverse filtering and parameterization. Results for F sentences suggest that focalization depends on the balancing of focal and non-focal portions of the entire IP. Local prominence-enhancing shifts (towards tenser phonation) are complemented by deaccentuation of post-focal material. While the broad trends are similar in F and R contours, the rising F0 of the R sentences appears to counteract the deaccentuation pattern found with the F contours. Thus, focal accentuation yields less source differentiation in the later portions of the IP.},

This view has consequences for the analysis of fricatives in Russian vs. Turkish: Russian fricatives undergo final devoicing, while Turkish fricatives do not. By contrast, unlike Russian fricatives, Turkish fricatives induce [spread glottis] assimilation in following sonorants. We show that these differences are upheld in three phonetic studies, extending the relevance of the ‘laryngeal realism’ hypothesis to fricatives as well as stops.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present and evaluate a method for training a statistical part-of-speech tagger on data from written language and then adapting it to the requirements of tagging a corpus of transcribed spoken language, in our case spoken Swedish. This is currently a significant problem for many research groups working with spoken language, since the availability of tagged training data from spoken language is still very limited for most languages. The overall accuracy of the tagger developed for spoken Swedish is quite respectable, varying from 95\% to 97\% depending on the tagset used. In conclusion, we argue that the method presented here gives good tagging accuracy with relatively little effort.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a Maximum Entropy learner of grammars and lexicons (MaxLex), and demonstrates that MaxLex has an emergent preference for minimally abstract underlying representations. In order to keep the weight of faithfulness constraints low, the learner attempts to fill gaps in the lexical distribution of segments, making the underlying segment inventory more feature-economic. Even when the learner only has access to individual forms, properties of the entire system are implicitly available through the relative weighting of constraints. These properties lead to a preference for some abstract underlying representations over others, mitigating the computational difficulty of searching a large set of abstract forms. MaxLex is shown to be successful in learning certain abstract underlying forms through simulations based on the [i]\textasciitilde [Ø] alternation in Klamath verbs. The Klamath pattern cannot be represented or learned using concrete underlying representations, but MaxLex successfully learns both the phonotactic patterns and minimally abstract underlying representations.},

But how, more precisely, are the Indo-European languages related to each other? This book brings together pioneering research from a team of international scholars to address this fundamental question. It provides an introduction to linguistic subgrouping as well as offering comprehensive, systematic and up-to-date analyses of the ten main branches of the Indo-European language family: Anatolian, Tocharian, Italic, Celtic, Germanic, Greek, Armenian, Albanian, Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic. By highlighting that these branches are saliently different from each other, yet at the same time display striking similarities, the book demonstrates the early diversification of the Indo-European language family, spoken today by half the world's population.

  abstract = {For a long time Japanese was taken to be a language lacking a subject-object asymmetry in subextraction. Two recent experimental studies have challenged this conclusion suggesting that Japanese complex NP (CNP) subjects are more opaque to subextraction than CNP objects (Jurka 2010; Jurka et al. 2011). Given the significance of this claim for the cross-linguistic landscape of subextraction phenomena, this study further explores the nature of subextraction phenomena in Japanese with three acceptability judgment experiments. We show that overt subextraction (scrambling) out of CNP subjects and objects results in similar acceptability ratings once the relative weight and order of constituents are properly controlled for. Recent experimental work which suggested that Japanese has a subject-object asymmetry to subextraction predicted that wh-in-situ adjuncts should lead to greater degradation for subextraction out of subjects as compared to subextraction out of objects. To test this prediction, we also present novel experimental data on wh-in-situ phrases inside subjects and objects in Japanese. Our results show that the argument/adjunct status of wh-in-situ phrases does not interact with the subject/object status of the CNPs, further invalidating the recent claims. Together these findings support the traditional view that Japanese has no subject-object asymmetry in subextraction, whether overt or covert. Having restored the status of Japanese as a language with no subject-object asymmetry in subextraction, we discuss possible reasons that could account for the absence of such an asymmetry. We suggest that the lack of asymmetry is due to Japanese subjects’ inability to satisfy the EPP on T/C; we further contend that cross-linguistic variation in subject transparency follows from whether or not the feature D comes from subjects.},

The paper relies on Song’s (1996) typology of causative marker formation to show that the causative prefix *k- has developed out of the marker of the potential mood following de-subordination of the subordinate clauses of purpose. This work contributes to the field of Zapotecan linguistics, by tracing the evolution of an important pan-Zapotec morpheme, and to that of diachronic typology (e.g., Bickel 2007), by validating a proposed developmental sequence in the area of valence-related morphology.},

As established by previous cross-linguistic studies of suppletion, most suppletion phenomena in Zapotec occur in the verb system. Nominal suppletion is attested in the possessed forms of selected nouns, such as tortilla, clothing, house, and pueblo, and the numeral system includes suppletive forms of the numeral first. Verbal suppletion types include suppletion based on aspect, mood, person/number of the subject, person of the oblique object, and valence. Each category of nominal and verbal suppletion is represented by a small number of strongly suppletive forms that appear to be etymologically distinct and a larger number of weakly suppletive forms that appear to derive from morphological processes that have ceased to be productive. By documenting suppletion phenomena across the Zapotec family, the present study aims to contribute both to the comparative Zapotec linguistics and to the empirical basis of the typological and theoretical investigation of suppletion.},

  abstract = {In German, past participles not only occur in root position with a directive force, as in Stillgestanden! ‘Stop!’ lit. ‘stood still(ptcp)’, but also as performatives in responses: A: Du sagst also nichts zu Papi. ‘So you won’t tell dad.’ B: Versprochen! ‘I promise!’ lit. ‘promised(ptcp)’. Here B performs the speech act denoted by the verb by saying that it has been performed. The propositional argument of the participle (what is promised) is resolved contextually, and the agent and the recipient arguments are restricted to the speaker and the hearer, respectively. This article presents a syntactic analysis of this rarely studied phenomenon, arguing that the construction with a performative participle is not ellipsis but an IP with a participial head and null pronominal complements. The syntactic analysis is formalized within Lexical-Functional Grammar. A pragmatic analysis is proposed arguing that the performative participle in its core use alternates with Yes! to express agreement with an assertion or compliance with a request, that is, to express consent to the effect that a proposition p may safely be added to the Common Ground. This analysis is cast within the dialogue framework of Farkas \& Bruce (2010) and extended to response performative participles in monological uses.*},

Therefore, it is predicted that postsyntactic processes like Linearization may affect morphological case assignment. I argue that this prediction is correct by demonstrating that prepositional case in Scottish Gaelic is assigned solely under linear adjacency with P. To account for this, I propose that Morphological Case Assignment is a postsyntactic process derivationally ordered after Linearization, as in Arregi and Nevins 2012. This accounts for several typologically rare properties, such as the presence of closest conjunct case.},

Unlike regular raising, however, Tongan AR shows characteristics of A-bar movement such as long-distance dependency, sensitivity to islands, and syntactic ergativity. This chapter argues that Tongan AR involves three operations: (a) topic movement of a DP to the embedded [Spec, C], (b) cancelation of the previous valuation of the case feature on the DP in [Spec, C], and (c) subsequent case valuation under Agree with the matrix v. The proposed analysis calls for a parametric adjustment to the activity condition to allow for multiple case valuation: in languages like Tongan, a DP located at the edge of a phase not only remains active, but the valuation of its case feature gets undone upon completion of the CP phase.},

We discuss some general problems of this approach and go on to provide a novel set of data involving modal particles in German, which we show to be incompatible with its fundamental assumptions. Our conclusion is that the move-and-delete theory of ellipsis should be abandoned, and deletion properly confined to the phonological component.},

We analyzed the use of gaze and the communicative behaviors produced by children. The time spent looking at the story increases in the IDS condition regardless of the language of the narration. Children produced more multimodal communicative behaviors while watching the IDS version both in Spanish and in Basque.

Copied morphemes are frequently assumed to enter the recipient language via 'indirect affix borrowing', whereby complex lexemes are copied and subsequently analyzed into their component parts in the recipient language, thus enabling use of the copied affixes with native roots (Grant 2012, Seifart 2015, Evans 2016). Although 'direct affix borrowing', in which speakers of the recipient language identify the meaning of affixes in the model language and transfer them directly for use with native roots, is known to occur, it has until now been identified only for derivational morphemes (Seifart 2015). I here provide evidence that inflectional morphemes, namely four Sakha (Yakut) tense-aspect-mood markers plus associated subject agreement paradigms, were copied directly into the Lamunkhin dialect of Even by fully bilingual speakers. This argument is based on the absence of Sakha verbal roots found with these paradigms in a corpus of Lamunkhin Even recordings, as well as on patterns of cooccurrence of these morphemes in clauses with Even grammatical morphology.*},

  abstract = {The thesis is concerned with a peculiar extraction construction in German, called wh-copying. The peculiarity of this extraction construction is that the fronted constituent seems to be repeated in all intermediate clause initial positions. This peculiarity is interesting from a theoretical point of view, as it raises a number of questions regarding the way extraction is implemented in the grammar. After an inspection of mainly new data from German, the thesis argues first that the term wh-copying is a misnomer. The apparent copies of the fronted constituent are actually independent elements, more specifically, pronominals. These however often happen to be homophonous to the fronted constituent. Secondly, it is shown that these independent elements are nevertheless subject to a number of matching constraints requiring partial identity between this element and the fronted constituent. The theoretical challenge posed by these two results is the tension between them. On the one hand, the repeated element is distinct from the fronted constituent; on the other hand, it has to share some properties with it. The thesis then argues that this tension can be resolved if the Arc Pair Grammar framework is adopted. That the repeated element is a pronominal distinct from the fronted constituent is an effect of the interplay between the analyses for pronominals and extractions. Extraction in general creates a context in which pronominals can appear in clause initial positions; wh-copying is then nothing but the result of exploiting this option. The matching conditions regulating the features the fronted and the repeated element have to share can be subsumed under a single and simple requirement, viz. the requirement that both elements agree in the grammatical relation they bear. The reason why Arc Pair Grammar allows a resolution of the tension has to do with the analytical tools this framework provides. On the one hand, only the Arc Pair Grammar analysis of pronominals allows one to capture the connection between extraction and the presence of pronominals. On the other hand, since only Arc Pair Grammar recognizes grammatical relations as primitives, only it allows the formulation of such the requirement that the fronted constituent and the repeated element have to agree in their grammatical relation. In addition to this, the thesis also argues that the tension cannot be resolved in an adequate manner without recourse to these analytical tools. In the remainder if the thesis it is shown that these tools also offer insight into a number of syntactic phenomena completely different from wh-copying.},

Hawaiian is also an endangered language. Not only was the native population decimated after contact with foreigners and foreign diseases but the language itself came under attack after the occupation of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893 (for more on Hawaiian history, see Coffman 2009, Sai 2011). Children were thereafter banned from speaking Hawaiian at school and indeed ‘physical punishment for using it could be harsh’ (Native Hawaiian Study Commission 1983: 196). In the decades that followed, Hawaiian was gradually replaced by an English-based creole (HCE or Hawaiʻi Creole English) for practically all Hawaiʻi-born children (Bikerton \& Wilson 1987, also Sakoda \& Siegel 2003). By the end of the 1970s, most surviving Hawaiian speakers were over 70 years old and fewer than 50 speakers were under the age of 18 (Kawaiʻaeʻa, Housman \& Alencastre 2007).},

It has often been invoked by linguists as an explanatory principle underlying various cross-linguistic phonotactic generalizations, especially within the domain of the syllable. However, many phonologists and phoneticians have expressed concerns about the adequacy of formal accounts based on sonority, including even doubts about the very existence of sonority itself. To date, the topic of sonority has never been the focus of an entire book. Consequently, this is the first complete volume that explores diverging viewpoints about phonological phenomena rooted in sonority taken from numerous languages. All of the contributors are well-known and respected linguists who publish their research in leading academic outlets. Furthermore, each chapter in this collection contains new, cutting-edge results based on the latest trends in the field. Hence, no other extant piece of literature matches this volume in terms of its breadth and coverage of issues, all converging on the common theme of sonority. Given the wide variety of subtopics in this collection, there is something to appeal to everyone \&\#8212; the list of contributions encompasses areas such as Optimality Theory, acquisition, computational modeling, acoustic phonetics, typology, syllable structure, speech perception, markedness, connectionism, psycholinguistics, and even MRI technology. What ties all of these issues together is a solid and consistent emphasis on sonority as a unified background phenomenon. Furthermore, a continuum of opinions about sonority is represented, ranging from complete acceptance and enthusiasm, on the one hand, to moderate skepticism on the other hand.},

This paper seeks to help resolve this problem by providing physical evidence supporting the sonority hierarchy. This is accomplished by reporting the results of a rigorous experiment measuring sound levels of realizations of all phonemes in English, Spanish, and Quechua. The obtained intensity values yield an overall mean Spearman's correlation of .91 with the proposed sonority indices. Consequently, one possible way to informally characterize sonority is in terms of a linear regression equation based on the observed intensity results. In light of these findings, the frequent claim that sonority lacks a reliable phonetic basis can no longer be maintained.},

  abstract = {This dissertation presents results of a cross-linguistic survey of phonologically conditioned suppletive allomorphy (PCSA). One hundred thirty-seven examples are discussed, representing 67 languages. Three major generalizations emerge from the survey. First, PCSA occurs at the same edge of the stem as the trigger: PCSA in prefixes is triggered at the left edge of the stem, while PCSA in suffixes is triggered at the right edge. Second, PCSA is sensitive to underlying rather than surface forms. This is demonstrated in several examples where phonological processes render opaque the conditions determining allomorph distribution. Finally, despite its characterization in recent literature, PCSA is not always optimizing. In numerous examples, words are no more phonologically well-formed than they would be if there were no allomorphy, or if the distribution of allomorphs were reversed. The generalizations arising in this survey distinguish between competing frameworks for modeling phonological conditions on affixation. The first is the ‘P » iVF approach, where PCSA is modeled by ranking (P)honological constraints over (M)orphological constraints in Optimality Theory. This model predicts that PCSA should be phonologically optimizing and that allomorphy may be sensitive to phonological conditions anywhere in the word. In the alternative approach, advocated here, PCSA is modeled by incorporating phonological elements of stems into the subcategorization frames of affixes. Subcategorization frames specify the type of stem to which affixes will attach, including syntactic, morphological, and (crucially) phonological features of stems. The distribution of suppletive allomorphs results from different requirements imposed by each allomorph on stems. This approach predicts that allomorphy should be sensitive to input rather than surface phonological elements and that PCSA should be sensitive only to elements at the edge of the stem where the affix attaches. These predictions are upheld in the survey. In the introduction and conclusion, I situate these findings in the broader context of the literature on the phonology-morphology interface. I also consider predictions of the models discussed above for other types of phonological effects in morphology, showing that research in those areas converges with the results presented here.},

  abstract = {In Indonesian, the voicing of the root-initial obstruent determines the outcome of /məŋ-/ prefixation. When that consonant is voiceless, it coalesces with the prefix-final nasal to produce a nasal with the same place of articulation as the obstruent, in a process referred to as nasal substitution (e.g., /məŋ + paksa/ → [məmaksa] ‘to force’). When the root-initial obstruent is voiced, though, simple place assimilation results (/məŋ + buat/ → [məmbuat] ‘to make/do’). In traditional analyses of nasal substitution, the limitation to voiceless consonants is expressed as a featural restriction on the scope of the relevant rule. No attempt is made to derive this restriction from principles active elsewhere in Indonesian, or in other languages. Pater (1999) points out that Indonesian is far from alone in its avoidance of nasal-voiceless obstruent clusters and invokes a substantive output constraint against these clusters, *NC, as the formal driving force behind processes like nasal substitution, postnasal voicing, nasal deletion, and denasalization. The Optimality Theoretic ranking between *NC and faithfulness constraints determines which of these routes a language chooses to take to eliminate nasal-voiceless obstruent clusters. Despite the relative success of the *NC account in formally connecting nasal substitution to a crosslinguistic range of phonological processes, in this chapter I will argue for a reanalysis, based on evidence from other Austronesian languages as well as Indonesian itself.},

Our objective function incorporates a term aimed to ensure generalization, independently required for phonotactic learning in Optimality Theory, and does not have a bias for single URs for morphemes. This learner is successful on a test language provided by Tesar (2006) as a challenge for UR learning. We also provide successful results on learning of a toy case modeled on French vowel alternations, which have also been previously analyzed in terms of abstract URs. This case includes lexically conditioned variation, an aspect of the data that cannot be handled by abstract URs, showing that in this respect our approach is more general.},

It provides an intuitive graphical interface (the "Builder") as well as the option to insert Python code. This combination makes it easy enough for teaching, but also flexible enough for all manner of behavioural experiments. As a result, PsychoPy has become the software package of choice in psychology departments at universities all over the world. Divided into three parts and with unique learning features to guide readers at whatever level they are at, this textbook is suitable for teaching practical undergraduate classes on research methods, or as a reference text for the professional scientist. The book is written by Jonathan Peirce, the original creator of PsychoPy and Michael MacAskill who have utilised their breadth of experience in Python development to educate students and researchers in this intuitive, yet powerful, experiment generation package},

  abstract = {The minimalist program includes the important conjecture that all (or most) properties of syntactic computation in natural language should be understood as arising from either (1) the interactions of independent mental systems; or (2) ‘general properties of organic systems’. The study of case morphology and the distribution of nominal expressions in the languages of the world is one of the areas in which generative syntax has made the most-profound advances over previous approaches. A large (and increasing) number of studies have identified patterns and principles of great generality – achievements that also shed light on other topics and puzzles. At the same time, it is fair to say that the phenomenon of case represents one of the more outstanding challenges for the minimalist conjecture. Though case is indeed an area in which complex phenomena can be predicted on the basis of more general principles, these principles themselves look quite specific to syntax and morphology, with little apparent connection to external cognitive systems. The discussion in this article reflects the provisional character of the investigation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            This article traces the diachronic development from the Proto Norse demonstrative               hinn               via the Old Icelandic definite article(s) to the Modern Icelandic article system. This demonstrative gave rise to two distinct article elements during the Viking period that are well-attested from Old Icelandic onwards, a freestanding and a suffixed article.                          Based on evidence from Old Icelandic, I argue for a categorial distinction between an adjectival and a nominal article, which does not entirely coincide with a mere morpho-phonological distinction. The former, which mostly occurs as a freestanding element, is a genuine component of AP, not an immediate constituent of the nominal extended projection. The latter, which only occurs in suffixal form, heads a low projection in the extended nominal projection and has scope only over the noun. For Modern Icelandic, on the other hand, I will adopt the idea that free and suffixed articles are two surface manifestations of the same element.                            The diachronic perspective is complemented by an examination of the development of seven adjectivally modified definite noun phrase patterns. This empirical survey reveals several surprising facts: The standard pattern of modification in Modern Icelandic was virtually non-existent prior to the 17               th               century, and double definiteness persisted until the early 20               th               century. Likewise, certain modificational patterns otherwise found in Mainland Scandinavian were dominant between the 16               th               and 19               th               century. This latter observation points to a competition between two adjectival articles               hinn               vs.               sá               similar to the one that had taken place earlier in Mainland Scandinavian. In Icelandic, however,               sá               did not replace               hinn               , and, in the long run, a pattern not comprising an adjectival article became the dominant one.},

  abstract = {Isthmus Zapotec (autoglossonym: [dìʤàˈzàˑ]) is the common name used for a variety of Zapotec (Otomanguean family) spoken on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico (Suárez 1983: xvi; Campbell 1997: 158). It is now officially listed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI 2008) as ‘zapoteco de la planicie costera’ (‘coastal plain Zapotec’) to distinguish it from other varieties of Zapotec spoken on the Isthmus. It is the mother tongue of many inhabitants of various cities and towns, as well as many smaller communities (INALI 2008), with some lexical, syntactic and phonetic variation between towns only a few kilometers apart. The ISO 639-3 code for this variety is zai. Since the most recent census figures do not separate out the varieties of Zapotec, and have not done so reliably when attempted, official statistics as to the number of speakers of Isthmus Zapotec are not available. (The               Ethnologue               (Lewis 2009) cites the 1990 census as listing 85,000 speakers; that figure must have been an interpretation of other statistics in the census.) INALI (personal communication, September 2008) estimates the current number to be about 104,000. In the city of Tehuantepec, the language is no longer widely used. In certain other locations, including Juchitán de Zaragoza, Spanish is becoming the dominant or the only language spoken by many people born after about 1990, although Zapotec is dominant in many outlying towns, including San Blas Atempa. Mature speakers have remarked that young people who are not fluent do not use tones correctly. Isthmus Zapotec has had active writers, including poets and novelists, since the first half of the twentieth century, well before an orthography was officially established (               Alfabeto popular               1956), but reading and writing of the language are still not taught in schools in the region.},

The volume starts with a chapter on subordination in general, followed by chapters on subordinate clauses that function as argument or as satellite in their sentence. Separate chapters are devoted to subordinate clauses governed by nouns and adjectives and to relative clauses. In addition there are chapters on coordination, comparison, secondary predicates, information structure of clauses and sentences including the use of emphatic particles, word order, and various discourse phenomena such as sentence connection. As in Volume I, the description of the Latin material is based upon texts from roughly 200 BC to AD 450. The Latin texts that are discussed are provided with an English translation. Supplements contain further examples to illustrate the main text. The grammatical framework used is mainly that of Functional Grammar but the description is accessible for readers without a modern linguistic background.},

This chapter considers the derivational relationship between VSO and VOS in the Polynesian language Tongan. VSO order is basic in Tongan, and we address the derivation of VOS from this basic order in the context of multiple possibilities. We argue that Tongan VOS is better analyzed as rightward displacement of the subject as opposed to leftward displacement of the object proposed by Otsuka (2005a,c). The clause-final subject shows many of the hallmarks of rightward movement, including information-structural restrictions, locality with respect to the matrix clause, lack of clitic doubling, and connectivity with respect to case and binding. Given that rightward movement has an uneasy place in syntactic theory, we take pains to establish that the analysis is successful and worth further scrutiny.},

Systematic comparison of the behavior of individuals, diagnostics, and language-mixing types (code-switches, established loanwords, and nonce borrowings) reveals variability at every level of the adaptation process, providing strong evidence that bilinguals do not phonetically distinguish other-language words, nonce or dictionary-attested, in a uniform way. This is in striking contrast to the community-wide morphosyntactic treatment they afford this same material when borrowing it: immediate, quasi-categorical, and consistent. This confirms that phonetic and morphosyntactic integration are independent. Only the latter is a reliable metric for distinguishing language-mixing types.*},

Our sample includes articulography recordings of eleven clusters for seven languages. We find that cross-linguistic variability is conditional on cluster composition. Previous suggestions that languages may have individual global articulatory timing profiles for consonant clusters in terms of an overall relatively lower or higher degree of overlap are not confirmed for our sample. All included languages converge on a relatively higher degree of overlap for some of the clusters, whereas only some of the languages additionally extend into the lower overlap range, particularly for stop-sonorant sequences. Manner and voicing are further identified as factors conditioning variation in consonantal overlap. Overall languages differ in their degree of overlap in multi-faceted ways, but the relative effects of cluster composition work in the same direction across languages.},

A Maximal Utilisation bias would prefer phonological patterns in which all rules are maximally utilised, and a Transparency bias would prefer patterns that are not opaque. Results from the experiment suggest that these biases affect the learnability of specific parts of a language, with Maximal Utilisation affecting the acquisition of individual rules, and Transparency affecting the acquisition of rule orderings. Two models were used to simulate the experiment: an expectation-driven Harmonic Serialism learner and a sequence-to-sequence neural network. The results from these simulations show that both models’ learning is affected by these biases, suggesting that the biases emerge from the learning process rather than any explicit structure built into the model.},

However, the causal precedence of the two factors remains unclear. We focus on the causal structure of variable lenition. Study 1 examines the relationship between three correlates of lenition—speech rate, stress, and low information content—and their effect on reduced duration and increased intensity. We find that though increased intensity is more prototypically viewed as the core aspect of lenition, the effect of the three correlates on intensity is mediated by duration. Study 2 shows that all frequent lenition processes in the Buckeye corpus involve durational reduction. The contribution of this article is a proposal with a fairly simple principle, with few auxiliary assumptions: reduced duration precedes increased intensity in variable lenition.*},

  abstract = {This study focuses on a corpus assembled from commercial recordings of 1929 and 1932 featuring the two British linguists J. R. Firth (1890–1960) and Daniel Jones (1881–1967). The aim is to analyse and quantify differences in the Received Pronunciation (RP) used by the two men, in relation to sociolinguistic and stylistic variation within RP of the period. A systematic acoustic analysis reveals that whereas the vowel systems of the two speakers are closely similar in most respects, there are significant differences in the realizations of the trap, price and dress qualities. We show that each of these has a well-documented history of variation in RP, and find that in each case Firth is employing the higher-class or more prestigious variant, which is a reversal of expectations based on what is known about the social and regional origins of the two. We consider the possible roles of social background, avoidance of regional features and hypercorrection. The outcomes of our work are (i) an illustration of RP used in the interwar period for the purposes of teaching English as a foreign language, (ii) empirical evidence for internal variation within the accent, (iii) additional insights into the stylistic and social correlates of this variation, and (iv) a demonstration that satisfactory formant analyses can be conducted with recordings from as early as the 1920s. Overall, it is hoped that this case-study will both throw light on the ‘standard’ accent of the era and inspire further sociophonetic investigations with legacy recordings.},

The learning approach follows the principle of Minimum Description Length (MDL), which has recently been used for learning in both constraint-based and rule-based phonology. The architectural question on which we focus is whether the grammar allows language-specific statements to be made at the level of the lexicon, as was assumed in early generative phonology, or whether such statements are prohibited, as is commonly assumed within more recent work. We show that under MDL, the architectural question has real empirical implications: across a range of seemingly natural representational schemes, an ability to make language-specific statements about the lexicon is needed to ensure the learnability of an important aspect of phonological knowledge.},

  abstract = {This squib proposes to extend the traditional taxonomy of pairwise process interactions (which contains “feeding,” “bleeding,” “counterfeeding,” and “counterbleeding”) to include the classes “shifting” and “countershifting.” A process “shifts” another if it does not feed or bleed it but rather causes it to apply in a different way. “Countershifting” is the opaque counterfactual inverse of shifting, and it fills a terminological gap identified by Kiparsky (2015). The class of countershifting interactions is claimed to be theoretically significant: Harmonic Serialism is able to apply the opaque process in countershifting interactions but generally not in counterfeeding or counterbleeding.},

Phonetics: Transcription, Production, Acoustics, and Perception introduces readers to the fundamental concepts of the discipline, providing coverage of all four areas of phonetics. This comprehensive textbook also familiarizes readers with concepts from other disciplines related to phonetics--such as physiology, anatomy, and psychology--through relatable, real-life examples. Now in its second edition, the text has been substantially revised to improve clarity and currency, based on student feedback received by the authors over the past decade. Brief "Nutshell" introductions have been added to all chapters to provide a clear overview of key points within the body of the text. Expanded content to this new edition examines voice quality, the acoustic correlates of different phonation types, intonation, and different theories of speech perception. Written in a clear and concise style by two of the field's leading scholars, this textbook: Covers related relevant areas, including vocal fold vibration and the physiology of the ear. Offers examples from other languages to highlight aspects of phonetics not found in English. Includes chapter-by-chapter exercises, engaging illustrations, and a detailed glossary. Features a companion website containing additional resources such as figures and sound files. Is taught in nearly every linguistics department as a required course for undergraduates majoring in linguistics. It is also taught in speech sciences / speech pathology. There are books that cater specifically to this market but there's a fair number of instructors in Communication/Speech Science departments who use books written by linguists"--},

Curaçao Papiamentu has both lexically distinctive stress and, independently, a word-level tone contrast. On the basis of a detailed acoustic investigation of this tonal contrast, we propose a privative phonological interpretation of the tone contrast, similar to proposals for the Scandinavian word-accent systems (Riad 1998, to appear). As compared to previous treatments of Curaçao Papiamentu word prosody, our hypothesis makes crucial reference to intonation and to tonal underspecification. We also investigate the realisation of primary and secondary stress in Curaçao Papiamentu.},

This paper studies these questions by examining the frequencies with which schwa is inserted in different segmental contexts, and by exploring the nature of the interaction between schwa insertion and prosodic prominence. The results show the coexistence of two types of schwa in the language: a transitional schwa and a prosodically triggered schwa. The former is ignored by the phonological system of the language; its occurrence depends solely on the phonetic characteristics of the adjacent consonants. The latter surfaces whenever a prosodically prominent feature does not attach to a vowel or sonorant already present within the word. Both schwas are argued to be manifestations of a more general principle governing the coordination pattern of consonant sequences in Tashlhiyt.},

  abstract = {Agents have been claimed to be universally more prominent than verbal arguments with other thematic roles. Perhaps the strongest claim in this regard is that agents have a privileged role in language processing, specifically that there is a universal bias for the first unmarked argument in an utterance to be interpreted as an agent. Symmetrical voice languages such as many western Austronesian languages challenge claims about agent prominence in various ways. Inter alia, most of these languages allow for both 'agent-first' and 'undergoer-first' orders in basic transitive constructions. We argue, however, that they still provide evidence for a universal 'agent-first' principle. Inasmuch as these languages allow for word-order variation beyond the basic set of default patterns, such variation will always result in an agent-first order. Variation options in which undergoers are in first position are not attested. The fact that not all transitive constructions are agent-first is due to the fact that there are competing ordering biases, such as the principles dictating that word order follows constituency or the person hierarchy, as also illustrated with Austronesian data.*},

Central to the analysis are two constraints: one requires that the feature [spread glottis] be shared by adjacent consonants, and another prohibits moraic [spread glottis] stops. Aspirated stops are singleton stops that are specified as [spread glottis]. Unaspirated stops either have no [spread glottis] feature or share a [spread glottis] feature with another consonant. There is no movement of aspiration or the [spread glottis] feature from one segment to another as in earlier analyses. This account is fully in accord with phonetic descriptions and is of theoretical interest because it supports the fission analysis of preaspiration and is consistent with the assumption that geminates are moraic consonants.},

Much has been written on the licensing conditions for embedded V–Neg, but formulating the exact conditions has proven difficult. This may be due to the fact that research has typically focussed on selected sets of clauses allowing this phenomenon and much of it has been based on the authors’ grammaticality judgements. Drawing conclusions about the licensing conditions for embedded V–Neg requires examining all types of environments that allow it in natural speech as well as the types of environments that disallow it. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to map out the full distribution of embedded V–Neg. This paper examines embedded V–Neg collected from five corpora of spontaneous Norwegian speech. The data provide information on the relative frequency of V–Neg in various constructions and identify hitherto unattested contexts for this word order. The paper shows that V–Neg is productive in adjunct clauses, a fact difficult to accommodate under accounts claiming it is licensed under selection of specific predicates. The data support a more discourse-oriented approach to embedded V–Neg.},

While North Germanic has suffixal definite articles leading to cases of double definiteness, weak adjective endings regulated by definiteness, and doubly-filled definite DPs, West Germanic does not. These three properties cluster together in that they all have to do with definiteness. It is claimed that they can be subsumed under one more general difference. Assuming various subcomponents of definiteness, it is proposed that these components originate low in the structure. North Germanic arranges these components into several individual feature bundles. Some of these bundles move to D, while others remain lower in the structure. Consequently, definiteness components are spelled out separately in different positions. In contrast, West Germanic involves one complex feature bundle containing all definiteness components. In this language family, all of the components move to D as one bundle and, as a consequence, they are all spelled out as one determiner.},

The strongest form of this model is that all morphological operations take place in parallel, which I call the Morphology in Parallel Hypothesis (MPH). Although combining OT and DM is unorthodox in practice, I show that a growing body of data warrants this modification (Trommer 2001a, 2001b, 2002; Dawson 2017; Foley 2017; a.o.). I provide support for OT-DM from the distribution of verbal clitics in Degema, a language of southern Nigeria. Within, I argue that agreement clitics are inserted post-syntactically via the DM operation Dissociated Node Insertion (DNI), and further that verb complexes are formed post-syntactically via the operation Local Dislocation (LD), operating in tandem with a well-formedness markedness constraint which requires verbs to appear in properly inflected words. These DM operations are decomposed into a series of constraints which are crucially ranked. Candidates are freely generated from gen and are subject to all DM operations, and are evaluated via eval against the ranked constraint set. I illustrate that under the standard serial DM model in which DNI proceeds VI, this would result in the wrong output form, and that even after parameterizing DM operation order in response, this model does not adequately capture the motivations behind the morphological patterns.},

  abstract = {Hungarian adjectival sluices show agreement characteristics of predicative adjectives, even though the correlate of the adjective is in attributive position. This has been taken as evidence for the existence of non-isomorphic (i.e. copular/cleft) sources for the ellipsis site. However, such an analysis could only capture the distribution of apparent case-mismatches by positing copular sources for a subset of Hungarian sluices—a conceptually unappealing state of affairs. Instead we provide a more parsimonious analysis, which predicts the data without needing to posit exceptional sources. In particular, we argue for the existence of two different configurations: (1)~one involving isomorphic wh-sources followed by ellipsis, and (2)~one that does not involve ellipsis at all, but is rather a case of pseudosluicing. Pseudosluicing is the combination of a null subject and a null copula—elements that are independently available in the language, and whose restricted distribution explains constraints we observe on the distribution of pseudosluicing. Thus, on our analysis, only isomorphic wh-questions are possible sources for Hungarian sluicing structures, consistent with the most restrictive theories of elliptical identity.},

Whereas traditional tests and diagnostics tend to focus on identifying weaknesses and disabilities in the individual learner, diagnostics in a UDL approach focus much more on identifying weaknesses and barriers in the design of the learning context itself, making it possible to probe whether a different set of options, a different path, or a different design might lead to better learning for any given learner. A UDL approach to assessment assumes the fundamental centrality of emotions as part of the anticipated variability among all learners and asserts that when we place emotions front and center in assessment, we obtain more accurate and meaningful assessment results. In addition, a UDL approach incorporates recurring and flexible assessment throughout instruction to provide ongoing, actionable feedback to educators and students before failure takes place, when taking action can make a real difference for all. Teachers, students, parents, administrators, and assessment designers/developers all need accurate assessments and timely results to use as feedback to inform next steps. Instructional approaches with a foundation in UDL will reduce the inadvertent barriers to learning that many students currently face, making the assessment of progress toward expertise more accurate, informative, and useful, and enable the mosaic of all learners to become masters of learning itself.},

However, the assumption that there is such equivalence has recently been challenged by Breban (2018) for English and Schlücker (2013, 2018) for German. The present article defends the view that determiner genitives and identifying noun modifiers are sufficiently similar to alternate in certain choice contexts from a variationist perspective, which, as will be shown, proceeds from a notion of equivalence different from the one adopted by in-depth semantic–pragmatic studies. Proper noun modifiers take a prominent role among identifying noun modifiers in their ability to alternate with determiner genitives, but the argument and analysis in this article is not restricted to them.},

  abstract = {It has been claimed that the long established neutralization of the voicing distinction in domain final position in German is phonetically incomplete. However, many studies that have advanced this claim have subsequently been criticized on methodological grounds, calling incomplete neutralization into question. In three production experiments and one perception experiment we address these methodological criticisms. In the first production study, we address the role of orthography. In a large scale auditory task using pseudowords, we confirm that neutralization is indeed incomplete and suggest that previous null results may simply be due to lack of statistical power. In two follow-up production studies (Experiments 2 and 3), we rule out a potential confound of Experiment 1, namely that the effect might be due to accommodation to the presented auditory stimuli, by manipulating the duration of the preceding vowel. While the between-items design (Experiment 2) replicated the findings of Experiment 1, the between-subjects version (Experiment 3) failed to find a statistically significant incomplete neutralization effect, although we found numerical tendencies in the expected direction. Finally, in a perception study (Experiment 4), we demonstrate that the subphonemic differences between final voiceless and “devoiced” stops are audible, but only barely so. Even though the present findings provide evidence for the robustness of incomplete neutralization in German, the small effect sizes highlight the challenges of investigating this phenomenon. We argue that without necessarily postulating functional relevance, incomplete neutralization can be accounted for by recent models of lexical organization.},

The various proposals discussed in this chapter have attempted to integrate this hallmark of Celtic syntax into the scope of syntactic theorizing. Recent analyses of Celtic clausal structure, based on the VP‐internal subject hypothesis, the split‐Infl proposal, and the cartographic approach to the left periphery, represent a huge improvement over the previous accounts. Beside the verb–subject order, other dimensions must be taken into account for a proper characterization of the VSO phenomenology: agreement phenomena and the Complementarity Effect; the syntax of copular constructions, which present significant differences across Celtic, but are never V1; the existence of V2 structures in a V1 language, namely Breton. All these issues bear upon major theoretical questions, such as the nature of structure‐building processes, the status of head movement, the motivation for DP‐raising, the relation of syntax to morphology, the relevance of adjacency to morphological phenomena at PF, the nature of microparametric and macroparametric variation, and the potential connection between V1 and V2.},

  abstract = {A subset of Mayan languages feature “prosodic allomorphy,” a phenomenon involving morphological alternations at certain prosodic boundaries. In previous work, Henderson (2012) proposes that prosodic allomorphs in K’iche’ provide evidence for non-isomorphisms in the correspondence between syntax and prosody. In this paper, I argue against this view by building on a related extraposition analysis in Aissen 1992. I contribute novel data from prosodic allomorphy from two Mayan languages, Chuj and K’iche’, and show that upon further inspection, there is strong evidence for a syntactic analysis different from the one assumed in Henderson 2012. The new syntax leads to several predictions that are borne out, and crucially, does not force us to posit mismatches, allowing for a one-to-one correspondence between syntax and prosody. By taking apparent instances of mismatches as suggestive that the syntactic analysis must be revisited, the proposal aligns with work such as Steedman (1991), Wagner (2005, 2010), and Hirsch and Wagner (2015). Finally, I discuss how the proposal could be restated within phase theoretic approaches to the interface between syntax and phonology, concluding that Mayan prosodic allomorphy poses an interesting challenge for such accounts.},

We argue that optimality theory predicts the treatment of this process in terms of allomorphy, which in fact is desirable for a synchronic analysis. The consequence is that, with regard to iotation effects, the task of phonology is to account for the distribution of allomorphs rather than to derive them from a single underlying representation. While, as a result of diachronic changes, the allomorphs are arbitrary, their distribution is not. It follows from the interaction of universal phonological and morphological constraints, and from the considerations of segment markedness.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the role of the syllable in the phonology of English. In particular, it centres on the problem of shortening and ambisyllabicity. The latter has sometimes been equated with resyllabification (Borowsky 1986; Myers 1987). In this view, ambisyllabicity is a phonetic phenomenon and it is resyllabification that plays a role in phonology. We demonstrate that shortening and ambisyllabicity/resyllabification are, counter to the currently held belief, entirely independent of each other, even though quantity-related processes (shortening and lengthening) are set in syllabic terms. This study continues the general line of generative research on English begun originally by Chomsky \& Halle (1968, hereafter SPE ) and developed in a number of later contributions, notably by Rubach (1984), Halle \& Mohanan (1985), Myers (1987) and Yip (1987). Attention is focused on the latter two papers. The interpretations presented in these papers are revised and expanded in a number of substantial ways. The database has been broadened to cover the facts of British English, in particular Received Pronunciation (RP), as reported in the standard sources, such as Gimson (1970), Jones (1972), Jones \& Gimson (1977) and Harris (1994). While in most cases the choice of the dialect of English plays no role, there are some rules and facts that refer exclusively to RP (Schwa Insertion, Tapping, the distribution of [I]/[ ]). For the sake of consistency, all the transcriptions cited in this article are drawn from RP. The presentation is organised as follows. \textbackslash S 1 introduces the problem of shortening. \textbackslash S2 presents a complete list of the relevant classes of data and a partial critique of the analyses by Yip (1987) and Myers (1987).},

Sanskrit is studied by scholars of language, religion and literature, by historians, sociologists and anthropologists and anyone else with an interest in India's cultural heritage. Sanskrit as a language is quite simply beautiful, its structure complex enough to be interesting, but straightforward enough to be manageable. Knowledge of Sanskrit grants access to an enormous body of literature. Literary writing uses the means of a language to not just express a thought, but to express it in an interesting, appealing, artful way. Thus it always is more rewarding to read a work of literature in its original language. Yet the fact that much may be lost in translation is especially true in relation to Sanskrit: the breadth of meaning of Sanskrit words, and the way this breadth is used in Sanskrit poetry (especially in the form of puns and word play) sometimes make expressions or even whole sentences or texts nearly impossible to translate. Only in the original can one truly enjoy them. Furthermore, Sanskrit literature offers a wide window onto India: Sanskrit is the language not just of the sacred writings of Hinduism (and some of Buddhism and Jainism), but also of many other texts that have greatly influenced Indian culture and society over the course of more than two millennia"--},

  abstract = {Speech perception presents a parsing problem: construing information from the acoustic input we receive as evidence for the speech sounds we recognize as language. Most work on segmental perception has focused on how listeners use differences between successive speech sounds to solve this problem. Prominent models either assume (a) that listeners attribute acoustics to the sounds whose articulation created them, or (b) that the auditory system exaggerates the changes in the auditory quality of the incoming speech signal. Both approaches predict contrast effects in that listeners will usually judge two successive phones to be distinct from each other. Few studies have examined cases in which listeners hear two sounds in a row as similar, apparently failing to differentiate them. We examine such under-studied cases. In a series of experiments, listeners were faced with ambiguity about the identity of the first of two successive phones. Listeners consistently heard the first sound as spectrally similar to the second sound in a manner suggesting that they construed the transitions between the two as evidence about the identity of the first. In these and previously reported studies, they seemed to default to this construal when the signal was not sufficiently informative for them to do otherwise. These effects go unaccounted for in the two prominent models of speech perception, but they parallel known domain-general effects in perceptual processing, and as such are likely a consequence of the structure of the human auditory system.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the phonetic realization of rising pre-nuclear pitch accents in Persian. In a first experiment, the alignment of f0 valleys and peaks in pre-nuclear pitch accents was analyzed in controlled speech materials as a function of the syllable structure (open vs. closed) and vowel type (short vs. long) of the accented syllable. The results revealed that in words with antepenultimate stress, both the L and the H tones are anchored to specific segmental landmarks irrespective of syllable structure or vowel type. In particular, the L is consistently aligned with the onset of the accented syllable, and the H is placed with similar consistency in the vicinity of the first post-accentual vowel. In a second experiment, the variability in the timing and scaling of L valleys and H peaks was examined as a function of the proximity of the word boundary and of the following accent. The results revealed that while the alignment of the L was unaffected by changes in stress conditions, H peaks were significantly retracted as the syllable approached the end of the word. However, the proximity of the following accent did not produce a significant effect on H alignment. In addition, no significant differences were found on L and H scaling in different stress or tonal crowding conditions. Overall, the results contribute to a growing body of evidence that in the absence of upcoming prosodic pressure, the alignment of pitch targets is specified relative to segmental positions. A comparison between these findings and empirical findings from other languages reveals fine phonetic differences of segmental anchoring that are less likely to be interpreted in terms of distinct association-based phonological representations, and suggests that some aspects of segmental anchoring need to be explained in terms of continuous language-specific alignment rules.},

  abstract = {The English auxiliary system exhibits many lexical exceptions and subregularities, and considerable dialectal variation, all of which are frequently omitted from generative analyses and discussions. This paper presents a detailed, movement-free account of the English Auxiliary System within Sign-Based Construction Grammar (Sag 2010, Michaelis 2011, Boas \& Sag 2012) that utilizes techniques of lexicalist and construction-based analysis. The resulting conception of linguistic knowledge involves constraints that license hierarchical structures directly (as in context-free grammar), rather than by appeal to mappings over such structures. This allows English auxiliaries to be modeled as a class of verbs whose behavior is governed by general and class-specific constraints. Central to this account is a novel use of the feature               aux               , which is set both constructionally and lexically, allowing for a complex interplay between various grammatical constraints that captures a wide range of exceptional patterns, most notably the vexing distribution of unstressed               do               , and the fact that Ellipsis can interact with other aspects of the analysis to produce the feeding and blocking relations that are needed to generate the complex facts of EAS. The present approach, superior both descriptively and theoretically to existing transformational approaches, also serves to undermine views of the biology of language and acquisition such as Berwick et~al. (2011), which are centered on mappings that manipulate hierarchical phrase structures in a structure-dependent fashion.},

We argue that this reasoning is problematic: It involves arbitrary thresholds, and the results are potentially confounded by the different surface orders of the compared structures and non-syntactic factors. We present three experiments with designs that do not require defining thresholds of ‘low’ or ‘high’ coreference values. Instead, we focus on grammatical contrasts (wh-movement vs. relativization, subject vs. object wh-movement) and aim to identify and reduce confounds. The results show that reconstruction for A′-movement of DPs is not very robust in German, contra previous findings. Our results are compatible with the view that the surface order and non-syntactic factors (e.g. plausibility, referential accessibility of an R-expression) heavily influence coreference possibilities. Thus, the data argue against a theory that includes both reconstruction and a hard Condition C constraint. There is a residual contrast between sentences with subject/object movement, which is compatible with an account without reconstruction (and an additional non-syntactic factor) or an account with reconstruction (and a soft Condition C constraint).},

  abstract = {Phonological alternations are often specific to morphosyntactic context. For example, stress shift in English occurs in the presence of some suffixes, -al, but not others, -ing: , , . In some cases a phonological process applies only in words of certain lexical categories. Previous theories have stipulated that such morphosyntactically conditioned phonology is word-bounded. In this paper we present a number of long-distance morphologically conditioned phonological effects, cases where phonological processes within one word are conditioned by another word or the presence of a morpheme in another word. We provide a model, Cophonologies by Phase, which extends Cophonology Theory, intended to capture word-internal and lexically specified phonological alternations, to cyclically generated syntactic constituents. We show that Cophonologies by Phase makes better predictions about the long-distance morphologically conditioned phonological effects we find across languages than previous frameworks. Furthermore, Cophonologies by Phase derives such effects without requiring the phonological component to directly reference syntactic features or structure.},

  abstract = {This paper brings novel data to bear on whether nominal concord relationships are formed in the narrow syntax or post-syntactically. In Guébie, a Kru language spoken in Côte d’Ivoire, nominal concord marking on non-human pronouns and adjectives is determined not by syntactic or semantic features of the concord-triggering noun, but by the phonological form of the noun. Specifically, concord marking on pronouns and adjectives surfaces as a vowel with the same backness features as the vowels of the head noun. Assuming that syntax is phonology-free (Pullum \& Zwicky 1986, 1988), the fact that we see phonological features conditioning nominal concord in Guébie means that nominal concord must take place in the post-syntax. I expand on post-syntactic models of nominal concord in Distributed Morphology (Kramer 2010, Norris 2014, Baier 2015) showing that when combined with a constraint-based phonology, such an approach can account for both phonologically and syntactico-semantically determined concord systems. Additionally, the proposed analysis includes a formal account of ellipsis via constraints during the phonological component.},

  abstract = {This article expands on cophonologies by phase, a model of the interface between morphology and phonology, which was introduced in Sande \& Jenks 2018. The crucial innovation of cophonologies by phase is the enhancement of lexical or vocabulary items to include morpheme-specific constraint weights. These weights modify the default phonological grammar of the language only in the domain of evaluation that contains the triggering morpheme, where domains are determined by syntactic phase boundaries. The interactions of the default grammar and morpheme-specific constraint weights function as cophonologies (Orgun 1996, Anttila 2002, Inkelas \& Zoll 2005, 2007) in that they result in morphosyntactic construction-specific phonological grammars. Here, cophonologies by phase is shown to provide a unified account of syntactically, morphologically, and lexically conditioned phonological alternations, phenomena that have been analyzed using distinct theoretical tools in previous work. In order to demonstrate the application of cophonologies by phase to a diverse set of interface interactions, this article considers three case studies of phonological alternations in Guébie (ISO: gie), an endangered Kru language, each conditioned by a different set of extraphonological factors.*},

In this case study, a child acquiring the Papuan language Nungon in a remote village setting in Papua New Guinea uses two different non-finite verb forms as predicates of main clauses (‘root’ contexts) between ages 2;3 and 3;3. The first root non-finite form is an apparent innovation of the child, unacceptable in adult-to-adult speech, which must be learned from a special auxiliary construction in child-directed speech. The second root non-finite form functions like attested adult main clause use of the same form. During the study period, the first root non-finite form increases sharply to function as a default verb form, then decreases to nil by 3;2. The second increases gradually to near-adult levels. Both forms are non-finite and have similar proportions in the input. Thus, factors other than finiteness and frequency must explain their distributions.},

I discuss the misplacement of zu in Standard German due to auxiliary fronting, as well as other types of zu-misplacement found in dialects. I propose two parsimonious options for the analysis of the standard language as well as dialect cases, namely, i) precedence rules and ii) a special kind of infixing operation that was first proposed in the framework of Categorial Morphology (Bach 1984, Hoeksema 1985). I show that even though the first approach has its merits, the second one is more advantageous.*},

When the regular (associ- ated) segment is illegal in a given phonological context, it delinks and the floating substitute attaches to the position vacated. As a consequence, a plausible case can be made to the end that morphologi- cal computation never takes into account melodic information when selecting al- lomorphs: all candidate patterns have a purely phonological analysis based on one single underlier. This result is evaluated in the context of the debate regarding modu- larity: non-modular approaches that grant exhaustive simultaneous access tomorpho- logical and phonological information overgenerate, while the modularity-restricted architecture makes the correct prediction: the access of morphological computation to phonological information is selective (excluding melody). Finally, the multiple in- puts analysis (Mascaró 2007) is shown to face the same problem, albeit only for a subset of PCA patterns, the ones that are non-optimizing.},

  abstract = {We argue that some properties of sign language grammar have counterparts in non-signers’ intuitions about gestures, including ones that are probably very uncommon. Thus despite the intrinsic limitations of gestures compared to full-fledged sign languages, they might access some of the same rules. While gesture research often focuses on co-speech gestures, we investigate pro-speech gestures, which fully replace spoken words and thus often make an at-issue semantic contribution, like signs. We argue that gestural loci can emulate several properties of sign language loci (= positions in signing space that realize discourse referents): there can be an arbitrary number of them, with a distinction between speaker-, addressee- and third person-denoting loci. They may be free or bound, and they may be used to realize ‘donkey’ anaphora. Some gestural verbs include loci in their realization, and for this reason they resemble some ‘agreement verbs’ found in sign language (Schlenker and Chemla 2018). As in sign language, gestural loci can have rich iconic uses, with high loci used for tall individuals. Turning to plurality, we argue that repetition-based gestural nouns replicate several properties of repetition-based plurals in ASL (Schlenker and Lamberton 2019): unpunctuated repetitions provide vague information about quantities, punctuated repetitions are often semantically precise, and rich iconic information can be provided in both cases depending on the arrangement of the repetitions, an observation that extends to some mass terms. We further suggest that gestural verbs can give rise to repetition-based pluractional readings, as their sign language counterparts (Kuhn 2015a, 2015b; Kuhn and Aristodemo 2017). Following Strickland et al. (2015), we further argue that a distinction between telic and atelic sign language verbs, involving the existence of sharp boundaries, can be replicated with gestural verbs. Finally, turning to attitude and action reports, we suggest (following in part Lillo-Martin 2012) that Role Shift, which serves to adopt another agent’s perspective in sign language, has gestural counterparts. (An Appendix discusses possible gestural counterparts of ‘Locative Shift,’ a sign language operation in which one may co-opt a location-denoting locus to refer to an individual found at that location.)},

The sample text is transcribed from a recording of a male native of Kano in his late 30's. This variety of Hausa is considered “standard”. Though Kano is a large urban center with some internal variation in speech, the sound inventory is relatively homogeneous within the city and surrounding area. Kano Hausa is the variety most commonly heard on national and regional radio and television broadcasts in Nigeria as well as most international broadcasting, such as the BBC, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, and Voice of America. Kano Hausa is therefore familiar throughout the Hausa speaking areas of Nigeria as well as Hausa speaking communities in Niger, Ghana, and other areas outside northern Nigeria. Hausa has a standard orthography, in use since the 1930's and also based on the Kano variety. It is familiar to all Hausa speakers literate in the Romanized orthography. (Many Hausas are also literate in Arabic orthography, a variety of which has been used to write Hausa, probably for several centuries. The Arabic orthography for Hausa is less standardized than the Roman orthography and has little formally published literature.)},

  abstract = {During language acquisition, children must learn when to generalize a pattern – applying it broadly and to new words ('add –ed' in English) – and when to restrict generalization, storing the pattern only with specific lexical items. One effort to quantify the conditions for generalization, the Tolerance Principle, has been shown to accurately predict children's generalizations in dozens of corpus-based studies. This principle hypothesizes that a general rule will be formed when it is computationally more efficient than storing lexical forms individually. It is formalized as: a rule R will generalize if the number of exceptions does not exceed the number of words in the category N divided by the natural log of N (N/lnN). Here we test the principle in an artificial language of 9 nonsense nouns. As predicted, children exposed to 5 regular forms and 4 exceptions generalized, applying the regular form to 100\% of novel test words. Children exposed to 3 regular forms and 6 exceptions did not extend the rule, even though the token frequency of the regular form was still high in this condition. The Tolerance Principle thus appears to capture a basic principle of generalization in rule formation.},

  abstract = {This article explores an exemplar-theoretic approach to the integration of phonetics and phonology in the prosodic domain. In an exemplar-theoretic perspective, prominence categories, here specifically, pitch-accented syllables and unaccented syllables, are assumed to correspond to accumulations of similar exemplars in an appropriate perceptual space. It should then be possible, as suggested for instance by Pierrehumbert (2003), to infer the (phonological) prominence categories by clustering speech data in this (phonetic) space, thus modeling acquisition of prominence categories according to an exemplar-theoretic account. The present article explores this approach on one American English and two German databases. The experiments extend an earlier study (Schweitzer, 2011) by assuming more acoustic-prosodic dimensions, by excluding higher-linguistic or phonological dimensions, and by suggesting a procedure that adjusts the space for clustering by modeling the perceptual relevance of these dimensions relative to each other. The procedure employs linear weights derived from a linear regression model trained to predict categorical distances between prominence categories from phonetic distances using prosodically labeled speech data. It is shown that clusterings obtained after adjusting the perceptual space in this way exhibit a better cluster-to-category correspondence that is comparable to the one found for vowels, and that both the detection of vowel categories and the detection of prominence categories benefit from the perceptual adjustment.},

  abstract = {Among phoneticians, the Vocal Profile Analysis (VPA) is one of the most widely used methods for the componential assessment of voice quality. Whether the ultimate goal of the VPA evaluation is the comparative description of languages or the characterization of an individual speaker, the VPA protocol shows great potential for different research areas of speech communication. However, its use is not without practical difficulties. Despite these, methodological studies aimed at explaining where, when and why issues arise during the perceptual assessment process are rare. In this paper we describe the methodological stages through which three analysts evaluated the voices of 99 Standard Southern British English male speakers, rated their voices using the VPA scheme, discussed inter-rater disagreements, and eventually produced an agreed version of VPA scores. These scores were then used to assess correlations between settings. We show that it is possible to reach a good degree of inter-rater agreement, provided that several calibration and training sessions are conducted. We further conclude that the perceptual assessment of voice quality using the VPA scheme is an essential tool in fields such as forensic phonetics but, foremost, that it can be adapted and modified to a range of research areas, and not necessarily limited to the evaluation of pathological voices in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I want to investigate the consequences of an idea about focus prosody that was first put forward by lackendoff 1972, namely the hypothesis that the focusphonology interface in grammar is expressed as a relation between focus-marked syntactic constituents on the one hand, and prosodic stress prominence on the other. A strong form of the hypothesis, advocated in Truckenbrodt's 1995 thesis and pursued here and in other recent work of mine (e.g. Selkirk 2002), is that the focusphonology interface consists only of interface constraints on the relation between syntactic focus and prosodic prominence. All the other predictable, nonmorphological, phonological properties of focus are claimed to be derived as a consequence of phonological markedness constraints on the relation between prosodie prominence and other aspects of phonological representation. This proposal can be called the Focus-Prominence theory of the focus-phonology interface. I think this theory provides an insightful account of the array of phonological properties that are associated with focus crosslinguistically, and at the same time explains the observed generalizations about focus projection and the distribution of focus-related prominence within the sentence. The question of focus projection is not addressed in this paper (but see Selkirk 1999, 2000; Selkirk and Katz, in preparation). What I want to show here is that Focus Prominence theory provides the basis for an understanding of focus-related phonological phrasing. In this I am following a path first charted out by Truckenbrodt 1995.},

  abstract = {The bulk of evidence concerning the syntax-phonology interface shows an influence of syntax on phonology. The domain structure for sentence-level phonological and phonetic phenomena, which forms part of the surface phonological representation (PR) of the sentence, is defined through an interaction of two types of constraints: syntax-prosodic structure interface constraints, which call for certain properties of the surface syntactic representation of the sentence (PF) to be reflected in domain structure in PR, and prosodic structure markedness constraints, which call for the surface prosodic structure to display patterns of unmarked prosodic structure. The effects of prosodic markedness constraints argue against direct access theories, which see phonological phenomena as defined directly on the surface syntax. Distinguishing PF and PR raises the question whether PF is input to the phonological component, with PR the output, as in standard models of generative grammar, or whether there may be mutual influence. Current models of grammar would countenance effects in the other direction, with the possibility of phonological principles constraining the range of acceptable surface syntactic representations, and research is beginning to explore this area.},

The present study examines selectivity in the acquisition of complex onsets and codas in English, and specifically in the acquisition of biconsonantal (CC) clusters in each position compared to triconsonantal (CCC) clusters. The data come from the naturalistic productions of three English-speaking children. The results indicate that children only attempt to produce target tokens with a CCC onset after they have successfully produced target tokens with a CC onset, and that the same occurs in the case of codas. Frequency, morphological complexity, sonority, and /s/ clusters were examined and ruled out as possible explanations of these acquisition patterns. Overall, this suggests that children are selective in their target words, and only attempt to produce words that contain a cluster after they have produced words containing a shorter cluster of the same type (i.e., onset/coda).},

In fact, the Japonic languages exhibit a surprising typological diversity. For example, some varieties display a split-intransitive as opposed to nominative-accusative system. The present volume is thus a unique attempt to explore the typological diversity of Japonic by providing a collection of grammatical sketches of various local varieties, four from Japanese dialects and five from Ryukyuan. Each grammatical sketch follows the same descriptive format, addressing a wide range of typological topics.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel locality violation and its repair in Sierra Zapotec: an object pronoun cannot cliticize when the subject is a lexical DP. This locality effect differs from more familiar ones (e.g., superiority) because the lexical DP does not move. We argue that it is nonetheless able to Agree, consistent with the idea that locality conditions apply to Agree, rather than to a separate movement component. We develop an account in which pronouns and lexical DPs interact with the same probe because they share featural content. In particular, we suggest that the person domain extends to include non-pronominal DPs, so that all nominals are specified for a feature we call δ (to resonate with DP); all and only personal pronouns are specified for π. This account requires a departure from Chomsky’s (2000, 2001) classical system of featural co-variation (Agree). A functional head must be able to participate in overprobing, interacting with a goal even though its requirements would appear to be met. We introduce a probe activation model for Agree, in which, after applying once, the operation can but not need apply again. We also consider two other mechanisms recently proposed to derive overprobing — Deal’s (2015, 2020) “insatiable probes” and Coon \& Keine’s (to appear) “feature gluttony” —though neither is able to account for the locality pattern.},

The article substantiates this hypothesis with respect to a particular view of pronouns: pronouns are ‘‘elsewhere’’ elements. Just as the interpretation of ordinary pronouns, on this view, is determined by competition with anaphors, so the interpretation of resumptive pronouns is determined by competition with gaps. On the basis of new facts in Hebrew and systematic differences between optional and obligatory pronouns, I argue that the tail of a relative clause movement chain is realized as the least specified form available. Since their interpretive properties are fully determined by external factors, resumptive pronouns must be part of the syntactic derivation, not items merged from the (traditional) lexicon.},

This article addresses this gap through the presentation of a case study of Lachixío Zapotec speech registers indexed though falsetto, breathy, creaky, modal, and whispered voice qualities. I describe the system of contrastive speech registers in Lachixío Zapotec and then track a speaker on a single evening where she switches between three of these registers. Analyzing line-by-line conversational structure I show both obligatory and creative shifts between registers that co-occur with shifts in the participant structures of the situated social interactions. I then examine similar uses of voice qualities in other Zapotec languages and in the two unrelated language families Nahuatl and Mayan to suggest the possibility that such voice registers are a feature of the Mesoamerican culture area.

The resulting construction can have complex interactions with verbal meaning that merit careful investigation in a fieldwork setting. In this paper, we describe our experiences as semanticists and language consultants exploring associated motion in two Zapotec languages: Dille’ xhunh Laxup (Santiago Laxopa Zapotec) and Dizhsa (San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec). We present an original storyboard and other materials used in our work, and reflect on our experiences at three different levels: (i) what we have learned about the semantics of associated motion constructions in these particular languages; (ii) what we have learned about eliciting associated motion constructions; and (iii) what we have learned about working together as fieldworkers and language experts.},

  abstract = {Linguistic sound systems necessarily possess contrastive values  that are  sufficiently distinct from one another that their individual characters  may  be learned by the listener. In this way, any given value in any given system  fulfils its functional role of rendering forms distinct which differ in  meaning. Articulatory, aerodynamic, acoustic and auditory constraints  serve to mediate between such sound–meaning correspondences in non-trivial  ways. Indeed, if it can be shown that the sound patterns of language  are in part explainable by these physical systems, then students of  linguistic sound systems would do well to study in detail the phonetic  base. Consider an example case. Laryngeal gestures and supralaryngeal  gestures are by and large articulatorily independent of each other. Thus,  for example, a voiceless aspirated stop consists of an oral occlusion,  cued  by silence, as well as an articulatorily independent laryngeal abduction,  cued by broadband noise. Were the phonetic realisation of these two  gestures strictly simultaneous, the cues signalling the laryngeal abduction  would not be perceived as such by the listener (*[               o               t]).  A listener can tell that  there is no voicing, but cannot recover more specific information regarding  the state of the glottis during oral closure. Stated simply, the full closure  here reduces the acoustic output to zero. With zero acoustic energy, no  source information other than silence is transmitted to the listener.  However, upon staggering the two gestures, the otherwise obscured  information is rendered salient.},

The familiar feature-scale saltation pattern cannot be modeled in HG without additional formal devices (White 2013), but deletion saltation arises as a simple gang effect under classic Correspondence Theory faithfulness constraints. If future work finds corresponding empirical differences between the two saltation types (e.g., in learnability), this would support weighted-constraint models such as HG over ranked-constraint models such as OT, and in addition would be evidence against MAX and DEP constraints on privative features and against the *MAP approach to faithfulness.},

However, wh prosody and the prosody/scope relationship show variation both within and between speakers. In particular, the relationship between wh prosody and wh scope is not necessarily the same in perception and production, even for the same speaker; this is consistent with previous findings from Tokyo Japanese. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Productive core-periphery structure should show synchronic evidence for a HIERARCHY OF FOREIGNNESS (Kiparsky 1973) among non-native phonological structures, and should give rise to IMPOSSIBLE-NATIVIZATION EFFECTS (Ito \& Mester 1999, 2001)--speakers should reject a nonce loanword that nativizes a 'less-foreign' structure while preserving a 'more-foreign' one. We carried out an experiment to collect nonce-loan nativization judgments from speakers of Japanese in order to test these claims. We found, first, that participants have a hierarchy of foreignness that is approximately like the predicted one, but differs in the relative markedness of singleton [p] and sequences of nasal+voiceless obstruent; we also found some interspeaker variation in the hierarchy. Second, while most participants showed nativization preferences that look like impossible- nativization effects, not all participants had a consistent hierarchy of preferences across all constraint pairs. These results have implications both for the phonological analysis of existing stratum-specific alternations in Japanese and for theoretical approaches to loanword phonology.},

  abstract = {This dissertation presents a theory of markedness constraints that apply exclusively to material in phonologically prominent or "strong" positions, called here M/str(ong) constraints. It is proposed that two substantively based restrictions hold of such constraints. The first restriction is the Prominence Condition, which states that the only legitimate M/str constraints are those whose satisfaction enhances the perceptual prominence of the strong position in question. For example, an M/str constraint demanding high-sonority nuclei in the strong position stressed syllable is legitimate, but a constraint that simply bans a typologically marked feature value in some strong position is not. The Prominence Condition correctly predicts that all M/str constraints are prominence-enhancing or augmentation constraints. The second restriction, the Segmental Contrast Condition, applies to M/str constraints on positions that are strong for psycholinguistic (as opposed to phonetic) reasons. This restriction has its basis in the importance of psycholinguistically strong positions for early-stage word recognition. It prohibits any M/str constraint from referring to a psycholinguistically strong position if its satisfaction would impede early-stage word recognition, such as by neutralizing segmental feature contrasts (except for those that improve left-edge demarcation, which potentially facilitates word recognition). Thus, an M/str constraint calling for high-sonority nuclei in the psycholinguistically strong position initial syllable, despite passing the Prominence Condition, will be banned by the Segmental Contrast Condition; its satisfaction neutralizes a segmental contrast that is not at the left edge. The Prominence Condition and the Segmental Contrast Condition are formally implemented as filters on the output of generalized constraint-building schemas, determining which of the logically possible M/str constraints are actually included in the universal constraint set. In an extension of Inductive Grounding (Hayes 1999a), these and other constraint filters are viewed as the locus of functional grounding in the formal phonological system. This Schema/Filter model allows the constraint set to reflect substantive phonetic and psycholinguistic factors, while maintaining a view of phonology as a formal system that manipulates formal objects — including constraints and the basic phonological elements from which they are constructed — without direct access to fine-grained details of articulation, acoustics, perception, and processing.},

  abstract = {How and why speakers differ in the phonetic implementation of phonological contrasts, and the relationship of this 'structured heterogeneity' to language change, has been a key focus over fifty years of variationist sociolinguistics. In phonetics, interest has recently grown in uncovering 'structured variability'—how speakers can differ greatly in phonetic realization in nonrandom ways—as part of the long-standing goal of understanding variability in speech. The English stop voicing contrast, which combines extensive phonetic variability with phonological stability, provides an ideal setting for an approach to understanding structured variation in the sounds of a community's language that illuminates both synchrony and diachrony. This article examines the voicing contrast in a vernacular dialect (Glasgow Scots) in spontaneous speech, focusing on individual speaker variability within and across cues, including over time. Speakers differ greatly in the use of each of three phonetic cues to the contrast, while reliably using each one to differentiate voiced and voiceless stops. Interspeaker variability is highly structured: speakers lie along a continuum of use of each cue, as well as correlated use of two cues—voice onset time and closure voicing—along a single axis. Diachronic change occurs along this axis, toward a more aspiration-based and less voicing-based phonetic realization of the contrast, suggesting an important connection between synchronic and diachronic speaker variation.*},

To examine the developmental trajectory of VOT and F0 in toddlers’ perceptual space, a perceptual identification test with natural and synthesized sound stimuli was conducted with 58 Korean monolingual children (aged 2–4 years). The results revealed that toddlers’ perceptual mapping functions on VOT mainly in the high-pitch environment, resulting in more successful perceptual accuracy in fortis or aspirated stops than in lenis stops. F0 development is correlated with the perceptual distinction of lenis from aspirated stops, but no consistent categorical perception for F0 was found before four years of age. The findings suggest that multi-parametric control in perceptual development guides an acquisition ordering of Korean stop phonemes and that tonal development is significantly related to the acquisition of Korean phonemic contrasts.},

  abstract = {Generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) are increasingly popular in dynamic speech analysis, where the focus is on measurements with temporal or spatial structure such as formant, pitch or tongue contours. GAMMs provide a range of tools for dealing with the non-linear contour shapes and complex hierarchical organisation characteristic of such data sets. This, however, means that analysts are faced with non-trivial choices, many of which have a serious impact on the statistical validity of their analyses. This paper presents type I and type II error simulations to help researchers make informed decisions about modelling strategies when using GAMMs to analyse phonetic data. The simulations are based on two real data sets containing F2 and pitch contours, and a simulated data set modelled after the F2 data. They reflect typical scenarios in dynamic speech analysis. The main emphasis is on (i) dealing with dependencies within contours and higher-level units using random structures and other tools, and (ii) strategies for significance testing using GAMMs. The paper concludes with a small set of recommendations for fitting GAMMs, and provides advice on diagnosing issues and tailoring GAMMs to specific data sets. It is also accompanied by a GitHub repository including a tutorial on running type I error simulations for existing data sets: https://github.com/soskuthy/gamm\_strategies.},

The introduction covers a range of topics including basis functions, the smoothing penalty, random smooths, difference smooths, smooth interactions, model comparison and autocorrelation. It is divided into two parts. The first part looks at what GAMMs are, how they work and why/when we should use them. Although the reader can replicate some of the example analyses in this section, this is not essential. The second part is a tutorial introduction that illustrates the process of fitting and evaluating GAMMs in the R statistical software environment, and the reader is strongly encouraged to work through the examples on their own machine.},

  abstract = {The Eighth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (Leeds, 1975) provided an opportunity, at a discussion seminar called specially for that purpose, ‘The larynx and language’, for phoneticians anxious to put phonation distinctions on a more systematic footing to appeal to specialists in the aerodynamic aspects of laryngal activity and in the physiology of the larynx to help them with criteria to define the phonation distinctions so far observed in languages. In introducing the topic at the discussion seminar E. J. A. Henderson confined her examples to Cambodian, to illustrate the ‘sepulchral’ phonation appropriate to what she terms the lower register (Henderson 1952: 157); but a number of languages are listed in Catford 1964 as making lexically distinctive use of phonation types, Danish, Hindi, Nilotic, Javanese, and Gujerati (p. 36); and Ladefoged 1971 lists some of these and a considerable number of others, including Sindhi, Zulu, Hausa, Wolof, and French (pp. 12–19). In part this article is a continuation of that attempt to attract the attention of instrumental phoneticians to problems posed by phonation differences in languages such as these; but to a large extent it results from a re-examination of various published accounts of phonation distinctions that I undertook in the course of teaching general phonetics. The most comprehensive of these accounts, and the one that I shall chiefly refer to, is Catford 1964, and the tape-recording in which he illustrates a number of the phonation types that he distinguishes in that article; but I have also drawn on Sweet 1877 (3rd edition, 1906), guided by Henderson 1971, Pike 1943, Heffner 1950, Abercrombie 1967, and Ladefoged 1971.},

This paper discusses a case of apparently optimizing PCSA in Yindjibarndi (Pama-Nyungan, Wordick 1982), proposes an analysis in which suppletive allomorphy precedes phonology, and shows that the alternative – an analysis in which PCSA occurs in the phonological component of the grammar – should be dispreferred.},

  abstract = {This article proposes that the possible word orders for any natural language construction composed of n elements, each of which selects for the category headed by the next, are universally limited both across and within languages to a subclass of permutations on the ‘universal order of command’ 1, …, n, as determined by their selectional restrictions. The permitted subclass is known as the ‘separable’ permutations, and grows in n as the large Schröder series \{1, 2, 6, 22, 90, 394, 1806, … \}. This universal is identified as formal because it follows directly from the assumptions of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG)—in particular, from the fact that all CCG syntactic rules are subject to a combinatory projection principle that limits them to binary rules applying to contiguous nonempty categories., The article presents quantitative empirical evidence in support of this claim from the linguistically attested orders of the four elements Dem(onstrative), Num(erator), A(djective), N(oun), which have been examined in connection with various versions of Greenberg’s putative 20th universal concerning their order. A universal restriction to separable permutation is also supported by word-order variation in the Germanic verb cluster and in the Hungarian verb complex, among other constructions.*},

  abstract = {The Person-Case Constraint (pcc) is a restriction on co-occurring weak pronominal direct (do) and indirect objects (io) that restricts the person value of the do. This article presents a previously unnoticed variant of the pcc found in Slovenian, where the canonical pcc operates alongside a reverse pcc, where the restriction applies to the io. This pattern is not predicted by standard syntactic approaches to the pcc (which rely on inherent asymmetries between the io and do). It is argued that the pcc (in all its forms) arises with pronouns that are inherently unspecified for a person value and need to receive it externally from a functional head via Agree. The structurally higher pronoun blocks the structurally lower pronoun from receiving a person value, giving rise to the pcc. The reverse pcc then arises due to optional do-over-io clitic movement prior to person valuation. The proposed analysis is shown to capture cross-linguistic variation regarding the pcc including the Strong/Weak pcc split, which is attributed to a variation in the structure of pronouns. The article also establishes a cross-linguistic typology of the reverse pcc, where the reverse pcc exists exclusively as an optional pattern alongside the baseline pcc pattern.},

  abstract = {This article presents a descriptive and theoretical framework for the analysis of prosodic systems that have emerged from contact between African tone and European intonation-only languages. A comparative study of the prosodic systems of two Romance contact varieties, Central African French and Equatorial Guinean Spanish, shows that they feature two-tone systems, fixed word-tone patterns, tonal minimal pairs, the arbitrary assignment of tone in function words, and tonal processes. Evidence from further contact varieties and creole languages shows that similar systems evolved in other Afro-European contact ecologies. We conclude that tone is imposed by default on contact varieties and creoles that take shape in ecologies characterized by source-language agentivity in tone languages. In doing so, we argue against claims that tone necessarily cedes to stress during language contact and creolization. Instead, contact varieties and creoles partake just like other languages in the convergence processes that lead to the areal clustering of prosodic systems.*},

The well-documented processes of consonantal depletion which lead to the development of phonation-type registers and tones are presented within a general model. Lastly, phonological evolutions observed at advanced stages of segmental depletion are discussed. The concluding note concerns the aftermath of segmental depletion: the recreation of polysyllables.},

Teachers’ and children's utterances were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for CS frequency and type (i.e., inter-sentential, intra-sentential). 173 students were assessed with receptive vocabulary and dimensional card sort tasks, and their vocabulary and cognitive switching scores assessed using correlational and mixed effects analyses. Results show that inter-sentential and intra-sentential CS frequency is positively and significantly related to children's intra-sentential CS frequency. Overall, findings revealed that teachers code-switched habitually more often than for instructional purposes. Neither inter-sentential nor intra-sentential CS was significantly related to children's development in HL vocabulary, and intra-sentential CS was found to positively and significantly relate to children's growth in cognitive flexibility. These findings reveal the multi-faceted impact of teacher's CS on children's early development.},

The analysis of phase alternations in Rotuman offers a unified account of metathesis, deletion and umlaut as all undergoing splitting followed by fusion. A non-transposition analysis of multiple metathesis in Kwara'ae shows that a prosodically motivated locality restriction on the splitting domain is crucial in deriving the attested patterns. CC metathesis in Balangao is analysed as fusion followed by splitting. Eliminating transposition has several benefits: (a) it simplifies the inventory of operations in Harmonic Serialism, (b) it correctly predicts the locality restrictions on metathesis patterns with smaller constraint sets and (c) it accounts for the differences observed in the segment types involved in CV(VC) vs. CC metathesis.},

  abstract = {Like all the Celtic languages, Welsh displays a set of initial consonantal mutations. Most instances of mutation have a lexical or morphosyntactic trigger, but a number of the contexts for Soft Mutation are generally considered to be triggered under specific syntactic conditions. This paper investigates the precise syntactic environment in which the process applies. The idea that a major function of this mutation is to mark accusative case on the direct object of a finite verb has a long history, encompassing both traditional grammars and also work within the generative linguistic tradition. Recently, this proposal for 'direct object mutation' has been revived and extended, within a Minimalist framework, by Ian Roberts. Roberts argues that the mutation is linked with the raising of a finite verb, and marks (abstract) accusative Case. Here, a range of data is considered which has not previously been discussed in connection with syntactic Soft Mutation. On the basis of this, I argue that the trigger for mutation proposed by Roberts is unworkable, and that the Case hypothesis is both too weak and also too strong. An existing analysis of syntactic Soft Mutation, the XP Trigger Hypothesis, not only captures the generalizations discussed by Roberts, but also correctly predicts the occurrence of all other instances of the syntactic mutation, unifying these into a single environment. ©2005 Elsevier B.V.

We use the mechanisms of Nanosyntax, a theory of the architecture of grammar in which the lexicon stores entire syntactic subtrees, to show that there is a structural containment between semelfactives and degree achievements such that semelfactives include more syntactic structure than degree achievements. In this respect, the relative structure of these two verb classes contributes to Bobaljik’s (2012) general claim that syncretism anchors structural containment as well as to the ongoing discussion about the form of spell out in syntax. The resulting picture supports the view whereby the semantics of lexical items is determined by their fine-grained internal syntax.},

Under this view, many common French words are stored underlyingly with partially-activated word-final consonants, and others with gradient blends of partially-activated word-initial consonants. In this paper, we follow up some of that view's predictions and consequences, focusing on the acquisition of French liaison using GSRs. We compare our simulations of error-driven GSR learning with observed errors made by French-learning children, and find the results to be encouragingly similar. We also compare predictions about the end state of GSR learning with a pilot study reporting adult French speakers' use of liaison in nonce words, where we find a rather less good explanatory fit. The paper emphasizes the role of word and collocation frequency in the development of phonological patterns by a GSR learner, and outlines many future avenues for research.},

We argue that this approach's success is closely tied to Optimality Theory's fully parallel grammatical evaluation. In the constraint-based derivational framework of Harmonic Serialism (HS; McCarthy 2000, 2007b), reliance on observed surface forms as inputs can block the discovery of ‘hidden rankings’ between markedness constraints, preventing the learner from discovering a restrictive grammar. This paper illustrates the problem, using a pattern of positional vowel restrictions in Punu (Kwenzi Mikala 1980), and considers the role of various learning assumptions. We conclude that hidden rankings are a fundamental obstacle to restrictive error-driven learning in any HS-like framework, and that learning in such frameworks inevitably requires consideration of some unattested surface forms as inputs, even at the earliest learning stages.},

Adapting the proposal in Wilder 1997, where contracted auxiliaries are prosodically incorporated into the following predicate, we provide an account in which the differences across dialects with respect to contraction are explained in terms of the availability of different abstract structures.*},

In addition, it is claimed that NPOS is also an option in Modern Faroese, contrary to common belief, although it is much more restricted in Faroese than in Icelandic. These results demonstrate the usefulness of systematic corpus studies while at the same time reminding us of their limits. In addition, they shed a new light on the status of Faroese among the Scandinavian languages and on the nature of intra-speaker variation and grammar competition.},

  abstract = {Summary 		Our most widely-used model of tonogenesis is Haudricourt’s 1954 classic analysis of Vietnamese tonogenesis. This paper examines Vietnamese evidence and this dominant model of tonogenesis, arguing that the Haudricourt analysis should be updated, replacing its segmentally-driven model by a laryngeally-based model, incorporating the effects of voice-quality distinctions.             This proposed model provides phonetically-plausible paths of change, not just for Vietnamese, but also for the widely- attested correlations between initial voicing and pitch height and between voice quality and vowel quality. At the same time, these same laryngeal considerations provide a phonetic motivation for the preference for the development of breathy voice from voiced stop onsets over sonorants and fricatives. Of equal importance, the model appears to provide significant insights into tonogenesis in Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, that is, the applicability model is not restricted to any particular geographical area.             Zusammenfassung 		Eines der verbreitesten Modelle für den Ursprung und die Spaltung der Töne ist die klassische, von Haudricourt 1954 dargestellte Analyse der Tonogenese des Vietnamesischen. In diesem Aufsatz wird dieses eben genannte und in der Lehre der Tonursprung dominante Modell unter die Lupe genommen. Wir meinen, man sollte vielleicht die Haudricourt’sche Analyse etwas auffrischen, indem die segmentale Basis durch eine Fundierung ersetzt wird, die auf den Einfluss der Stimmen- Qualitaet (þvoice quality“) eingebaut ist.             Dieses neue Modell liefert phonetisch-plausible Möglichkeiten, nicht nur für das Vietnamesische, sondern auch für Sprachen in denen eine starke Korrelation zwischen der Stimmhaftigkeit der Anlauts-Konsonanten und der Höhe der Silbenfrequenz, sowie zwischen Stimmqualität und Vokal-Qualität vorliegt. Zur gleichen Zeit liefert die Einbeziehung des Stimmerzeugungsapparats eine phonetische Erklärung und Motivation dafür, dass Ver- schlusslaute den Vorteil über Frikativa und Sonorantlautung im Anlaut besitzen. Außerdem noch bringt es neues Licht in den Prozess der Tonogenese in Sprachen so divers wie diejenigen von Südost-Asien, Ost-Asien, Süd-Asien, Afrika, Europa, und Nord- und Südamerika, d.h. Sprachen in praktischen allen geographischen Gegenden der Welt.             Résumé 		Le modèle le plus communément accepté de tonogénèse est celui développé par Haudricourt dans son analyse classique du développement des tons en vietnamien en 1954. Le présent article ré-examine le modèle posé pour la tonogénèse en vietnamien et propose une révision du modèle d’Haudricourt, remplaçant une approche basée sur les segments par une approche basée sur les phénomènes laryngaux, en particulier sur les effets de différences de qualité de voix.             Le modèle que nous proposons décrit des séquences de changements phonétiquement plausibles, non seulement pour le vietnamien mais aussi pour les corrélations fréquemment attestées d’une part entre voisement initial et hauteur tonale, d’autre part entre qualité de voix et timbre vocalique. Les phénomènes laryngaux que nous décrivons expliquent aussi la prépondérance du développement de la voix soufflée à partir d’occlusives voisées plutôt qu’à partir de sonantes et fricatives. Ce modèle n’est pas restreint à une aire géographique particulière, mais éclaire la tonogénèse dans d’autres langues d’Asie du Sud-est, d’Asie, d’Afrique, d’Europe et des Amériques.},

  abstract = {Projective content is heterogeneous, with classes of projective content differing in several properties (e.g., Potts 2005; Tonhauser et~al. 2013). Recently, Tonhauser et~al. (2018) found that projective content in English varies in its projectivity both between and within classes, and also that there is by-participant and by-lexical content projection variability. This paper shows that projection variability is not unique to English but also attested in Paraguayan Guaraní, a Tupí-Guaraní language that is genetically unrelated to and typologically different from English. This finding suggests that projection variability may be a cross-linguistically universal property of projective content. The comparison of English and Paraguayan Guaraní also reveals parallels in how projective the content associated with a translation pair is. This finding strengthens the empirical support for the position that some projective content is nondetachable (e.g., Levinson and Annamalai 1992; Simons 2001; Abrusán 2011, 2016; Tonhauser et~al. 2013). The paper discusses implications for analyses of projective content, which differ in whether they lead us to expect projection variability and cross-linguistic similarities in projection variability. The paper also addresses methodological considerations in exploring projection variability in fieldwork-based research.},

In this paper we demonstrate that greater insights into a number of phenomena are achieved when they are analysed with CV syllabification and onset consonants that are moraic, a possibility independently proposed for a wide range of languages by Topintzi (2010). We review a range of evidence from phonetic studies, acquisition and musicology that points towards CV syllabification in Arrernte, and analyse allomorphy, stress assignment, reduplication and the transpositional language game ‘Rabbit Talk’ in terms of reference to moraic structure. The results lend themselves to new directions in the analysis of Arrernte, and provide further evidence for moraic onsets in prosodic morphology.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Extraction and subextraction tend to receive separate attention in syntax, which leads to the assumption that they should be analyzed independently, even though they both illustrate an asymmetry between subjects and objects. By looking at various phenomena in English, German, Spanish and Norwegian I propose that this parallel behavior is not accidental, but that there is a previously unnoticed generalization: subextraction is allowed iff extraction is possible and the target of subextraction is not an indirect object. I propose that a revised version of Spec-to-Spec antilocality (               Erlewine 2016               ) is necessary: movement of and out of an XP must cross a               Projection Line               (               PL               ) (               Brody 1998               ), i.e. the set of all projections of a head. This version of antilocality can derive               Freezing               effects,               Huang’s (1982)               CED               , and their exceptions; and               Comp-trace               effects and their neutralization, extending them to subextraction. However, antilocality on its own cannot derive the extraction-subextraction asymmetry in indirect objects. I propose that the Principle of Minimal Compliance (PMC) (               Richards 1998               ) can suspend antilocality if agree between a probe and a goal has happened. The version adopted here will allow extraction of the whole XP, but disallow extraction of its specifier due to the lack of an agree relation. Antilocality and the PMC combined also make the right predictions in other domains such as the lack of               do               -support in matrix subject questions and A-movement of the subject in declarative clauses, providing evidence that antilocality is a constraint that should apply to (at least) both A and A’-movement.},

Models of syllable structure based on data from ‘standard' accents such as Received Pronunciation (RP) therefore fail to account for patterns in nonstandard varieties.

WRAP-XP is argued to interact with the constraints on edge alignment proposed by Selkirk (1986, 1995), with a constraint against recursive structure, and with a constraint aligning an edge of a focus with a phonological phrase. WRAP-XP is intended to replace, and improve on, an earlier proposal by Hale and Selkirk (1987) to the effect that lexical government plays a role in the syntax-prosody mapping.

  abstract = {San Jerónimo Acazulco Otomi (SJAO) is an underdescribed and endangered Oto-Manguean language spoken in central Mexico. This paper provides an analysis of the phonology of tonal contrasts in SJAO and the phonetics of their realization based on pitch pattern data derived from audio recordings of citation forms of SJAO words. Each SJAO lexical word has one and only one tonal sequence – either /H/ or /HL/. This sequence is underlyingly associated with one syllable in the word. Other syllables are not specified for tone, and their phonetic realization is predictable depending on their position relative to the tonal syllable. A phonetic analysis revealed that underlyingly-tonal syllables are phonetically distinct from non-tonal syllables: those with /H/ are produced with greater vocal effort (measured by spectral tilt), and those with /HL/ are longer, louder, and bear a higher f0 (fundamental frequency), compared with non-tonal syllables. This analysis differs from previous accounts of lexical prosody in other Otomi varieties, which have either described a three-way system of high, low, and rising tones contrasting on every stem syllable, or a system where one syllable per word is assigned a stress-like ‘accent’. This difference from previous analyses suggests that there is a third possible characterization of lexical prosody for Otomi, which is appropriate for SJAO and potentially other understudied varieties.},

The speech described here is that of one of the authors, Merton Sandoval of Dulce, New Mexico. The Apachean group is comprised of Western Apachean (Navajo; the Western Apache dialects Cibecue, San Carlos, and White Mountain; and Chiricahua and Mescalero) Eastern Apachean (Jicarilla, Lipan) and Plains Apache (formerly called Kiowa Apache). The other major groups of Athabaskan languages include the northern group of languages spoken in Alaska and Canada, and the Pacific Coast group spoken in Oregon and California. While the western Apachean languages have a well-documented member in Navajo, the eastern group is less well known, being best documented so far in the works of Goddard (1911), Hoijer (1938, 1945, 1946a, 1946b) and Jung (1999). Differences between the western and eastern groups concentrate in consonant development and the evolution of stem shape, and, to some extent, in the lexicon; however, Jicarilla resembles all other Athabaskan languages in bearing a close morphological relationship to all its relatives.},

He argues that it constitutes evidence for a partly-unified postsyntactic module, in which morphology and prosody are built in parallel (by ‘Optimality-Theoretic Distributed Morphology’). We argue that the pattern Rolle identifies in Degema SVCs instead results from the simultaneous interaction of two independently-attested syntax-prosody phenomena: (1) the pressure for adjacent verbs in an SVC to form a single prosodic unit, and (2) the suppression of redundant agreement within a single prosodic word (a.k.a.~‘Kinyalolo’s Generalization’). Thus the Degema SVC conspiracy can be localized to the syntax-prosody interface, and there is no need to adopt a unified postsyntactic morphology-prosody module like Rolle’s. We offer some further conceptual critiques of his model.},

Furthermore, the category of                     agentivity has not been studied in detail in Zapotecan languages, but this paper shows the pervasiveness of agentivity in the                     Teotitlán Zapotec grammar.},

  abstract = {In German, complement clauses embedded by the wh-word wie (‘how’) have two different readings. The first is a manner reading expressing a manner or method of doing something. The second is called eventive in this paper because it expresses an event in progress instead of a manner. Ruling out ambiguity of wie, the question arises of why a manner word is used to express an event in progress. The basic semantic hypothesis in this paper is that wie expresses similarity (as it does in, e.g., similes). The paper starts from the observation that in the manner reading wie has a base position next to the verb and is a modifier of the event type whereas in the eventive reading it is base-generated above VP and thus adds information about the event token. The analysis includes two components: First, manners are considered as sets of similar events (instead of primitive objects), and methods, in particular, are considered as sets of similar sequences of subevents. Secondly, events in progress are seen as initial sequences in sets of similar natural continuations. From this point of view, an event in progress is like a method comprising sequences of subevents that share the same initial part. This analysis provides a semantic interpretation explaining why the wh-word wie expresses both the regular manner reading and the eventive reading depending on whether it modifies the event type or the event token.},

  abstract = {The present study aims to approach soft ‘g’, a highly disputable sound in Turkish phonetics and phonology, from a multidimensional perspective by (i) analysing its historical development, (ii) investigating its distribution in a dictionary of Modern Turkish, and (iii) studying its acoustic realization. In the Ottoman script soft ‘g’ was represented with two letters: {$<$}غ{$>$}, pronounced [ɣ], was used in the context of preceding back vowels Vback\_(Vback, C); {$<$}گ{$>$}, pronounced [j], was used in the context of preceding front vowels Vfront\_(Vfront, C). In 1928, due to a reform in orthography, these two vocalic contexts were obscured by replacing both {$<$}غ{$>$} and {$<$}گ{$>$} with {$<$}ğ{$>$}. Our investigation of the distribution of /ğ/ in the native vocabulary of Modern Turkish reveals that /ğ/ is in complementary distribution with /ɡ/: /ğ/ appears word-finally and word-medially (i.e. syllable-finally Vğ.C and intervocalically V.ğV), while /ɡ/ is found word-initially and word-medially (i.e. syllable-initially when following a consonant C.ğV). However, in loan words which are well assimilated into Turkish by means of phono-morphological rules the complementary distribution is not attested. Moreover, the behavior of soft ‘g’ in phonological processes strongly suggests that the sound is part of the phonemic inventory of Turkish. Finally, the results of our two acoustic experiments show that /ğ/ is phonetically manifested in the lengthening of the preceding vowel (/Vğ/ → [Vː]) independently of the surrounding vowel environment, word position, and participant age. In addition, the results indicate that speakers of Modern Turkish do not realize acoustic properties of a velar gesture.},

Children produced RCs later than in English (Diessel, 2004) and Mandarin (Chen \& Shirai, 2015), and demonstrated increasing semantic and structural complexity with age. Despite the morphosyntactic difficulty of object RCs, and prior experimental findings showing a subject RC advantage, preschool-aged children produced object RCs, which were highly frequent in child-directed speech, as frequently as subject RCs. Object RCs in spontaneous speech were semantically less demanding (with pronominal subjects and inanimate head nouns) than the stimuli used in prior experiments. Results suggest that multiple factors such as input frequency and morphosyntactic and semantic difficulty affect the acquisition patterns.},

In Swedish, existential predications may be negated by a standard negative marker. Another possibility to negate existence is by using a negative indefinite pronoun. In negation of existential predications in Swedish, the choice between standard negation and indefinite pronouns, whether negative or not, has not been previously described in any descriptive or theoretical work. It is therefore the purpose of the current study to describe what factors determine the choice of negative marker in existential predications. The results of this study show that there is a strong preference to negate existential predications with a negative indefinite pronoun. Further, it is shown that the negative indefinite pronoun is frequently used as a modifier to the pivot, and thus states an unconditional absence.},

An alternating element like /tera/ \textasciitilde{} /dera/ has an initial voiced obstruent in its rendaku allomorph and an initial voiceless obstruent in its non-rendaku allomorph. Lyman's Law blocks rendaku in a second element containing a medial voiced obstruent. This paper gives three arguments that Lyman's Law originated as a constraint prohibiting prenasalisation in consecutive syllables. First, constraints on similar consonants in close proximity generally apply not to voicing but to features with phonetic cues that are more spread out, such as prenasalisation. Second, in some Japanese dialects with prenasalised voiced obstruents, rendaku cannot occur if it would result in adjacent syllables containing these marked consonants.

  abstract = {A number of languages have been argued to establish basic word order by means of VP-fronting (e.g. Kayne 1994; Massam 2001 and many others). However, many such analyses face an overgeneration problem: some material thought to be VP-internal never appears fronted and must apparently always be stranded (Chung 2005; Massam 2010). This paper first provides novel evidence for VP-fronting in an SVO language, the understudied Polynesian outlier Imere (Vanuatu), motivated by the placement of adverbial particles. But this analysis too suffers from the stranding problem: VP-fronting cannot drag along any DPs, PPs, and CPs. At the same time, Imere has a familiar SVO VP, with no evidence of vacating movements or an unorthodox base-generated structure. To solve this issue, I propose that VP-fronting is accompanied by distributed deletion (Fanselow and Ćavar 2001), driven by a constraint that favors realizing only the verb. I extend this analysis to eight other VP-fronting languages, from five different language families. In all these languages, what remains in the fronted VP is a structurally reduced dependent, like an adverbial particle or a determinerless object. Building on Clemens (2014, 2019), I adopt a constraint that requires dependents of a head that spell out in the same phase to remain adjacent, thus surviving distributed deletion.},

  abstract = {Fijian displays a crosslinguistically unusual system of differential object marking (DOM) (Alderete 1998; Aranovich 2013). In typical DOM effects, objects higher in animacy and/or definiteness receive additional morphological marking and appear in higher syntactic positions. In Fijian, however, pronoun and proper name objects, although higher on standard DOM hierarchies, must remain verb-adjacent and surface without an article. This paper argues that this pattern arises because pronoun and proper name objects undergo morphological merger with the verb at PF, which allows a nominal to escape the Case Filter (Levin 2015; Branan 2017). I present evidence that, in contrast, common noun objects in Fijian are structurally reduced, and so do not need Case licensing. As a result, Fijian provides support for an approach to DOM in which objects higher in definiteness/animacy have an additional Case licensing need (e.g. Massam 2001; Danon 2006; Ormazabal and Romero 2013; Kalin 2018), and against theories that rely exclusively on differences in syntactic position or overt marking.},

  abstract = {A fundamental question in contemporary minimalist approaches to movement is why copies left by phrasal movement are not realized. Particularly puzzling from this perspective is the observation that pronouns, in a range of environments, appear to function as spell-outs of gaps (e.g. Zaenen et al. 1981; Koopman 1982, 1984; Sells 1984; Engdahl 1985; Pesetsky 1998; Boeckx 2003; Kandybowicz 2007; Holmberg and Nikanne 2008; Harizanov 2014; Sichel 2014), a phenomenon I refer to as pronoun copying. This paper first presents a novel pronoun copying pattern in the Nilotic language Dinka Bor, in which a 3rd person plural pronoun spells out intermediate copies at the verb phrase edge. I then show that Dinka pronoun copying displays two unusual number asymmetries that provide a unique insight into the link between pronoun copying and copy deletion: (i) the pronoun matches only in number, not person, and (ii) only plural DPs initiate copying. Importantly, this number sensitivity mirrors a general asymmetry in the expression of singular and plural. I argue that this parallel reveals that pronoun copying in Dinka reflects partial deletion in a DP copy, deleting everything but the structure that hosts number information. The availability of partial deletion in multiple copy spell-out is shown to follow from an approach to copy deletion based on economy, as developed by Landau (2006). In support of this, I demonstrate that Dinka’s asymmetries in fact have their counterparts across pronoun copying constructions and develop a unified account of pronoun copying crosslinguistically.},

  abstract = {This article presents novel data from the Nilotic language Dinka, in which the syntax of successive-cyclic movement is remarkably transparent. We show that Dinka provides strong support for the view that long-distance extraction proceeds through the edge of every verb phrase and every clause on the path of movement ( Chomsky 1986 , 2000 , 2001 , 2008 ). In addition, long-distance dependencies in Dinka offer evidence that extraction from a CP requires agreement between v and the CP that is extracted from ( Rackowski and Richards 2005 , Den Dikken 2009b , 2012a , b ). The claim that both of these components constrain long-distance movement is important, as much contemporary work on extraction incorporates only one of them. To accommodate this conclusion, we propose a modification of Rackowski and Richards 2005 , in which both intermediate movement and Agree relations between phase heads are necessary steps in establishing a long-distance dependency.},

Getting started with Bayesian modeling can be challenging, especially when one is trying to model one’s own (often unique) data. It is difficult to see how one can apply general principles described in textbooks to one’s own specific research problem. We address this barrier to using Bayesian methods by providing three detailed examples, with source code to allow easy reproducibility. The examples presented are intended to give the reader a flavor of the process of model-fitting; suggestions for further study are also provided.

  abstract = {This book is a grammar of Kalamang, a Papuan language of western New Guinea in the east of Indonesia. It is spoken by around 130 people in the villages Mas and Antalisa on the biggest of the Karas Islands, which lie just off the coast of Bomberai Peninsula. This work is the first comprehensive grammar of a Papuan language in the Bomberai area. It is based on eleven months of fieldwork. The primary source of data is a corpus of more than 15 hours of spoken Kalamang recorded and transcribed between 2015 and 2019. This grammar covers a wide range of topics beyond a phonological and morphosyntactic description, including prosody, narrative styles, and information structure. More than 1000 examples illustrate the analyses, and are where possible taken from naturalistic spoken Kalamang. The descriptive approach in this grammar is informed by current linguistic theory, but is not driven by any specific school of thought. Comparison to other West Bomberai or eastern Indonesian languages is taken into account whenever it is deemed helpful. Kalamang has several typologically interesting features, such as unpredictable stress, minimalistic give-constructions consisting of just two pronouns, aspectual markers that follow the subject, and the NP and predicate – rather than the noun and verb – as important domains of attachment. This grammar is accompanied by an openly accessible archive of linguistic and cultural material and a dictionary with 2700 lemmas. It serves as a document of one of the world's many endangered languages.},

The lexical level is marked by competitive effects associated with similarity neighborhood activation, whereas increased probabilities of segments and sequences of segments facilitate processing at the sublexical level. We investigated the two proposed levels in six experiments using monosyllabic and specially constructed bisyllabic words and nonwords. The results of these studies provide further support for the hypothesis that the processing of spoken stimuli is a function of both facilitatory effects associated with increased phonotactic probabilities and competitive effects associated with the activation of similarity neighborhoods. We interpret these findings in the context of Grossberg, Boardman, and Cohen’s (1997) adaptive resonance theory of speech perception.},

It argues against the traditional picture that assumes that specific expressions are a subclass of indefinite NPs. The paper rather assumes that the two categories are independent of each other. Definiteness expresses the discourse pragmatic property of familiarity, while specificity mirrors a more finely grained referential structure of the items used in the discourse. A specific NP indicates that it is referentially anchored to another discourse object. This means that the referent of the specific expression is linked by a contextually salient function to the referent of another expression.},

  author = {Wagner, Michael},

  institution = {{MIT}},

  abstract = {This thesis proposes a recursive mapping of syntactic derivations to prosodic representations. I argue that the prosody of an expression, just like its meaning, is determined compositionally, as originally proposed in Chomsky et al. (1957) and Chomsky and Halle (1968). Syntactic structure are cyclically spelled out and assigned a semantic and phonological interpretation. The cyclic approach is motivated based on data from the prosody of coordinate structures, integrating insights from syntax, combinatorics, and semantics. The algorithm distinguishes two ways of prosodically relating the output of cyclic domains: They can either be mapped to prosodic domains that are on a par and match in prosodic status: Prosodic Matching; or the output of one cycle can be prosodically subordinated to another cycle: Prosodic Subordination. Together, they derive a metrical structure that encodes information about phrasing, accent placement, and prominence. Scope relations, argument structure, and information structure affect prosodic phrasing indirectly by determining which of the two principles applies and when a syntactic cycle is spelled out. The derived metrical representation is a relational grid (Liberman, 1975). It encodes syntactic structure and also the derivational history of how it was assembled. The theory attempts to incorporate insights from recent work on stress and prominence (Cinque, 1993, Arregi, 2002) and prosodic recursion Ladd (1988), Dresher (1994), as well as insights from the research on prosodic phrasing and phrasal phonology (Gussenhoven, 1984, Selkirk, 1986, Truckenbrodt, 1995). Phonetic evidence from on-line production is presented to show that speakers implement the predicted metrical relations and scale boundaries later in the utterance relative to boundaries already produced, a phenomenon dubbed Boundary Strength Scaling.},

  abstract = {Generalizations about relative prosodic boundary strength are recursive. Initial evidence comes from the fragment of English consisting only of proper names and and and or. A systematic relation between the semantics, the syntactic combinatorics, and the prosodic phrasing of coordinate structures can be captured by recursively building up their prosody, in tandem with assembling their compositional meaning. Alternative edge-based approaches to prosodic phrasing fail to capture the recursive nature of the generalization, a result independent of whether or not prosodic representation itself is assumed to be recursive. The pattern generalizes beyond the grammar of coordination, despite two types of apparent counterexamples: Structures that are prosodically flat but syntactically articulated, and structures with an apparent outright mismatch between prosody and syntax. Closer inspection suggests that the syntax might actually be quite in tune with prosody. In both cases, natural language employs strategies to construe complex meaning with list-like structures rather than nested ones. The privileged status of lists may be due to processing factors.},

In General American English, a trimoraic syllable template makes largely successful predictions about contexts where tense/lax vowel contrasts are neutralised, but neutralisation preceding a coda rhotic has not been adequately explained. We attribute the apparent special properties of coda /ɹ/ to two characteristics of its representation, informed by our articulatory investigation: sequential coordination of dorsal and coronal subsegmental units and a high blending strength specification, corresponding to high coarticulatory dominance. Characteristics of coda laterals are compared. Our approach employs phonological representations where sequencing is encoded directly among subsegments, and coordination is sensitive to strength. Mora assignment is computed over sequencing of subsegments, predicting that complex segments may be bimoraic. The account brings phonotactics for rhymes with postvocalic liquids into line with the trimoraic template, and supports representing coordination and strength at the subsegmental level.},

This system is compared with the switch-reference systems (or lack thereof) reported for the other six Pomoan languages. Only Kashaya Pomo is reported to have the same system. The other five Pomoan languages have different systems or none at all. It is asserted that switch-reference was not present in Proto-Pomo and developed in different ways in a subset of offspring languages through entirely internal changes without influence from non-Pomoan language contact. In those languages where switch-reference (whether canonical or not) developed, systems with dedicated bound switch-reference morphemes are hypothesized to have been elaborated around the same two Proto-Pomo suffixes, *-Vn and *-pʰi.},

Based on Borer’s exo-skeletal model, I argue that there is no direct connection between the category and the form. The morphemes to be reduplicated enter syntax as roots which are unvalued both in categorial property and semantic content. The syntactic context determines both their category and the domain within which they must match with a reasonable content. I propose that there are three types of reduplication morpheme respectively involved in the derivations: ReASP, ReDER, ReDEG, and the relative order between reduplication and categorisation is the key factor affecting the availability of event structures and non-compositional interpretations. The study shows that some problems which are traditionally discussed in the morphological or semantic domain are in fact syntactic in nature.},

Because of her work and the work of earlier native Mutsun speakers with early linguists, there is a large written corpus of Mutsun. This dictionary was compiled by analyzing that documentation.

  abstract = {This study, following up on work on Dutch by Warner, Jongman, Sereno, and Kemps (2004. Journal of Phonetics, 32, 251–276), investigates the influence of orthographic distinctions and underlying morphological distinctions on the small sub-phonemic durational differences that have been called incomplete neutralization. One part of the previous work indicated that an orthographic geminate/ singleton distinction could cause speakers to produce an incomplete neutralization effect. However, one interpretation of the materials in that experiment is that they contain an underlying difference in the phoneme string at the level of concatenation of morphemes, rather than just an orthographic difference. Thus, the previous effect might simply be another example of incomplete neutralization of a phonemic distinction. The current experiment, also on Dutch, uses word pairs which have the same underlying morphological contrast, but do not differ in orthography. These new materials show no incomplete neutralization, and thus support the hypothesis that orthography, but not underlying morphological differences, can cause incomplete neutralization effects.},

  abstract = {This study investigates acoustic correlates of the putative breathy and clear phonation type contrast in a dialect of Khmer (Cambodian) spoken in Chanthaburi Province, Thailand. The goal is to determine whether this Khmer dialect still preserves this historical contrast. Out of seven acoustic parameters measured, four, namely *H1−*H2, *H1−A1, *H1−*A3, and vowel RMS amplitude successfully distinguished between breathy and clear vowels, with *H1−*H2 measured at the beginning of the vowel being the most robust cue. However, the use of these cues varied from speaker to speaker. The *H1−*H2 measurement obtained from male speakers’ production suggested that the contrast being realized may be that of a tense versus lax voice rather than a breathy versus clear voice. It is concluded that the historical breathy and clear phonation distinction in Khmer is preserved among female speakers, but this distinction may be disappearing or have become a tense versus lax distinction among male speakers.},

In Experiment 1 (N = 84), four- and five-year-olds heard speakers with different accents and indicated where they thought each speaker lived relative to a reference point on a map that represented their current location. Five-year-olds generally placed speakers with stronger accents (as judged by adults) at more distant locations than speakers with weaker accents. In contrast, four-year-olds did not show differences in where they placed speakers with different accents. In Experiment 2 (N = 56), the same sentences were low-pass filtered so that only prosodic information remained. This time, children judged which of five possible aliens had produced each utterance, given a reference speaker. Children of both ages showed differences in which alien they chose based on accent, and generally rated speakers with foreign accents as more different from their native accent than speakers with regional accents. Together, the findings show that preschoolers perceive accent distance, that children may be sensitive to the distinction between foreign and regional accents, and that preschoolers likely use prosody to differentiate among accents.},

As general education requirements undergo reform in higher education, the field of linguistics has an opportunity to assume a more central role. We argue that linguistics courses aligned with the key competencies of critical thinking, information literacy, and inquiry and analysis are well positioned to augment general education curricula, particularly at institutions that utilize common student learning objectives. An innovative The Language of Now core course and its signature assignment, a learner-centered research project on the use of the text-messaging discourse marker lol, illustrate how the methods used in linguistic inquiry are amenable to a range of standards that support general education goals.*},

  abstract = {In phonetics, many datasets are encountered which deal with dynamic data collected over time. Examples include diphthongal formant trajectories and articulator trajectories observed using electromagnetic articulography. Traditional approaches for analyzing this type of data generally aggregate data over a certain timespan, or only include measurements at a fixed time point (e.g., formant measurements at the midpoint of a vowel). This paper discusses generalized additive modeling, a non-linear regression method which does not require aggregation or the pre-selection of a fixed time point. Instead, the method is able to identify general patterns over dynamically varying data, while simultaneously accounting for subject and item-related variability. An advantage of this approach is that patterns may be discovered which are hidden when data is aggregated or when a single time point is selected. A corresponding disadvantage is that these analyses are generally more time consuming and complex. This tutorial aims to overcome this disadvantage by providing a hands-on introduction to generalized additive modeling using articulatory trajectories from L1 and L2 speakers of English within the freely available R environment. All data and R code is made available to reproduce the analysis presented in this paper.},

Furthermore, it provides an introduction to the language and its speakers, and an outline of a preliminary Pite Saami orthography. An extensive annotated spoken- language corpus collected over the course of five years forms the empirical foundation for this description, and each example includes a specific reference to the corpus in order to facilitate verification of claims made on the data. Descriptions are presented for a general linguistics audience and without attempting to support a specific theoretical approach, but this book should be equally useful for scholars of Uralic linguistics, typologists, and even learners of Pite Saami.},

  abstract = {This paper documents the number-related properties of Dëne Sųłiné (Athapaskan). Dëne Sųłiné has neither number inflection nor numeral classifiers. Nouns are bare, occur as such in argument positions, and combine directly with numerals. With these traits, Dëne Sųłiné represents a type of language that is little considered in formal typologies of number and countability. The paper critiques one influential proposal, that of Chierchia (in: Rothstein (ed.) Events and grammar, 1998a; Natural Language Semantics 6: 339–405, 1998b), and presents an alternative number typology, which introduces variation in the semantics of numerals. It will be shown that bare nouns in Dëne Sųłiné can be mass or count. Hence, the difference between count and mass cannot be expressed in terms of number, as in Chierchia. Instead, I express it in terms of atomicity. Mass nouns have nonatomic denotations, bare count nouns have atomic denotations that comprise singularities and pluralities. I also propose that numerals contain a function that accesses the singularities in a noun’s denotation. Hence they are compatible with bare count nouns, but not with mass nouns. In classifier languages, numerals denote a cardinality only; singularity-accessing functions are expressed in separate elements: the classifiers. Thus, languages like Chinese require classifiers because the numerals are semantically deficient, and not, as is assumed by Chierchia and others, the bare nouns.},

  abstract = {Other The first chapter reviews twentieth- century work on stress, considering stress from several points of view: as intensity, pitch and rhythm. The weaknesses of some approaches are pointed out. Some past work on isochrony is summarised and the metrical theory of stress introduced. The problem presented by stress in Welsh is introduced informally. The second chapter describes a series of measurements and experiments carried out to investigate stress in Welsh. Acoustic measurements are made of Fo, intensity, duration, and lengths of rhythmic feet. It is concluded that stress in Welsh is determined by rhythm rather than inherent acoustic cues. Statistical anal ysis of further measurements of feet reveal s the effects of syllabification and also supports the previous findings. Perceptual experiments using native speaker judgements of resynthesised speech are presented and analysed; it is concluded that Welsh stress is linked with rhythm and with consonantal length (the consonant after a stressed vowel being longer than one after an unstressed vowel), while it has no direct link with pitch- prominence as such. The third chapter outl ines a theoretical framework based on the 'metrical' theory of stress, and proceeds to apply it to Welsh . This modified framework makes use of Selkirk's 'prosodic units', but differs from the usual forms of the theory by also taking account of the semantic weight of words in the utterance context. It is agreed that this makes for a more explanatory theory, and some puzzles of English intonation are shown to be described more simply using such a theory. The patterns of intonation in Welsh are also described in this framework. The fourth chapter discusses the implications posed by the experimental results for the general theory of stress. Reference is made to some research in the psychology of stress perception, and evidence is also presented from the historical development of Welsh from ancient British times, and also from the Welsh bardic rules of versification. It is argued that Welsh has a unique contribution to make to our understanding of the nature of and possible forms taken by stress, and the conclusion is that stress in any language, and more particularly in English, may not be as straightforward a matter as has been hitherto assumed.},

In this paper, I argue that, despite the appearance of  agreement, which seems to license a null resumptive pronoun, relative clauses  formed on a number of syntactic positions (object of periphrastic verb, object of  preposition, embedded subject) may involve movement. Both movement and non-movement  strategies are argued to be available for some syntactic positions (object  of preposition, embedded subject), and separate constraints must therefore be  established for the distribution of each. Resumptive pronouns are argued to be  subject to a variant of the A´-Disjointness Requirement. For               wh               -trace, the Welsh  evidence is compatible only with an account involving multiple cyclic movement via  a VP-external position (SpecAgrOP) as well as SpecCP.},

  abstract = {This chapter considers the analysis of gap and resumptive wh-dependencies, especially relative clauses, in Welsh. It is argued that, despite first appearances, all wh-dependencies formed on unembedded direct-object positions (and some embedded ones), including the direct object of an aspectual periphrasis, involve movement and a gap rather than a resumptive pronoun. The clitic found in these structures is analysed as a reflex of the movement operation itself, with clitics appearing in positions from which wh-movement has taken place. The presence of a clitic is therefore not diagnostic of resumption. This conclusion is then integrated into a more general analysis of Welsh wh-dependencies, in which the gap strategy is argued to be more widely available in other contexts too. It is shown that Welsh manifests more extensive successive-cyclic effects than generally acknowledged. A formal analysis is developed in which the various successive-cyclic effects are accounted for within a movement-based approach. Successive-cyclic movement in Welsh is mediated by escape hatches in SpecCP and SpecvP, but the absence of equivalent escape hatches at the DP or PP levels results in the resumption strategy occurring in those environments. This approach is then extended to cases where resumptive pronouns appear to have gap-like syntactic properties, leading to a ‘mixed’ analysis of resumptive relatives generally (base-generation of a resumptive pronoun with movement of a wh-operator from the specifier of the phrase triggering resumption).},

  abstract = {This paper addresses two related problems. The major empirical problem concerns the difference between two pronominal forms found in German: personal pronouns and so-called d-pronouns, which are also used as relative pronouns. The major theoretical question concerns the nature of relative pronouns in general. I will argue that d-pronouns are definite determiners, i.e., full Determiner Phrases (DPs) containing an empty NP whereas personal pronouns are merely the spell out of phi features (AgrD) not containing an NP-projection. This will allow us to account for the distributional differences between the two forms. In addition, I will argue for a restriction on Operator-variable chains that will derive the fact that only d-words but not personal pronouns can be used as relative pronouns in a language that makes use of the A -movement strategy for relativization. It will also follow that relativization without A -movement is possible with either a personal pronoun or a gap occupying the relativized position.},

In this paper, we discuss the evidence for Incomplete Neutralization and we show that no phonology-induced phantoms need to be invoked in order to explain these findings. Rather, there are multiple hypotheses that allow grounding Incomplete Neutralization in well-known experimental phenomena such as lexical co-activation and phonetic convergence. These accounts allow marrying phonological completeness with phonetic incompleteness, and they are consistent with a large body of experimental work from other disciplines.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is concerned with the ways in which perceptual demands imposed by the listener contribute to the production strategies of the speaker. Its primary hypothesis is that the less robustly encoded the perceptual cues to a particular segment or contrast are, the more important cue preservation will be in production. Robustness of encoding can be defined along several dimensions: redundancy of cues, the auditory impact of cues and the resistance of cues to environmental masking. It is hypothesized that stop consonants unaccompanied by formant transitions (or other transitional information) must be audibly released for sufficient cues to be maintained in the acoustic signal. In a consonant cluster (C1-C2) a speaker will ensure an audible stop release by limiting the degree of overlap between the peak of strictures of the adjacent consonants to the point where the C1 release precedes the C2 peak of stricture. In inter-vocalic consonant clusters or in clusters where C1 has internal cues, nasals and fricatives, a greater degree of overlap will not result in a loss of crucial information in the acoustic signal. Therefore, there is a greater probability that there will be overlap between the C1 and C2 peaks of stricture. This hypothesis is tested by looking in acoustic detail at Tsou, an Austronesian language with a particularly rich set of word initial consonant clusters in both word onset and intervocalic positions. The results largely support the hypothesis: stops in positions where transitional cues are absent are produced in such a way that an audible release burst is maintained. In positions where transitional cues are present, the release burst is frequently absent from the acoustic signal indicating an increase in overlap between adjacent closures. The acoustic evidence also points to a greater degree of overlap in clusters where one or both consonants have internal cues. Furthermore, the patterns that are observed at normal speech rates are maintained at fast and slow rates.},

  abstract = {In this chapter we present a Realization Optimality‐Theoretic account of full and partial identity of forms, i.e. paradigmatic syncretism and cases in which lexemes share the same inflectional formative. Our approach involves both output‐to‐output correspondence constraints and realization constraints that associate morpho‐syntactic feature values with morpho‐phonological forms. We show that Realization Optimality Theory (Xu 2007) offers a unified account of these phenomena. Additionally, we argue that Realization Optimality Theory has advantages over several alternative approaches such as feature impoverishment‐plus‐insertion (Noyer 1998), rules of referral (Zwicky 1985; Stump 1993a), and two different models of OT morphology proposed by Müller (2007; 2008). We argue for an autonomous morphological component and also discuss related issues such as the morphology–phonology interface.},

  abstract = {This guide accompanies the following article: Zheng Xu, ‘Optimality Theory and Morphology’, Language and Linguistics Compass 5/7 (2011): 466–484. DOI: 10.1111/j.1749-818X.2011.00290.x Author’s Introduction This article introduces Realization Optimality Theory (OT), a novel and promising morphological framework which adopts the formalism of OT and encodes the morphological realization rules of, for example, Aronoff (1994) as ranked violable constraints. These language-particular realization constraints are interspersed with universal markedness constraints of morphology. This treatment of morphological realization in terms of constraints successfully accounts for various widely discussed morphological phenomena such as blocking and extended morphological exponence, the emergence of an unmarked morph under morpho-phonological conditions, syncretism and partial identity of forms. The teaching and learning guide provides an overview of the materials that are most related to this article and can be taught in class. The Author Recommends Rather than on a hierarchy of importance, the arrangement of the following suggested readings is based on a logical development of the topic of OT and morphology. The readings are intended for a 3-week course. Readers are supposed to get familiar with classical rule-based models of morphology first and then the general architecture of OT. Finally, they will learn about why a modified version of OT should be applied to morphology and what advantages such a move can bring us in comparison with rule-based models and conventional OT. Zwicky, Arnold M. 1985. How to describe inflection, ed. by M. Niepokuj, M. van Clay, V. Nikiforidou and D. Feder. Proceedings of the Berkeley Linguistic Society (BLS) 11. 372–86. This is an important article in inflectional morphology. It proposed a rule-based realizational framework to account for inflectional morphology and attracted many influential followers and challengers. In this article, Zwicky shows that paradigms are not mere arrays of forms, but have internal organization of considerable interest. Additionally, he shows that inflectional morphology is well captured within process-based models. He gives definitions of some important terms such as rules of referral, rules of exponence and discusses the ways in which realization rules are arranged. He illustrates his framework with a description of a substantial portion of the declensional system of standard German. Aronoff, Mark. 1994. Morphology by itself: stems and inflectional classes. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. This is one of the most influential works in inflectional morphology. Mark Aronoff argues that morphology must constitute a separate and autonomous component of the grammatical architecture rather than being a mere appendage of syntax and phonology. He argues that objects like morphomes and inflectional classes are purely morphological and cannot be reduced to either syntax or phonology. He demonstrates the application and formulation of realization rules and elucidates many important notions of morphology such as lexeme, lexicon, lexical representation, base, root, stem, citation form, and so on. This book is one of the must-reads in the field of morphology. Stump, Gregory T. 2001. Inflectional morphology: a theory of paradigm structure. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. This book is one of the must-reads in the field of inflectional morphology. It argues that morphology has its own autonomous system and equates the definition of a language’s inflectional morphology with the definition of its paradigm function. It proposes Paradigm Function Morphology, an inferential-realizational morphology framework that is based on realization rules, rules of morpho-phonology, and a series of principles that govern both the application and organization of these rules. Wurzel, Wolfgang Ullrich. 1989. Inflectional morphology and naturalness. Dordrecht: Kluwer. This important book introduces the concept of naturalness in grammar and discusses basic morphological concepts such as word and morpheme, inflection and derivation, inflectional rules, lexical representations, inflectional forms, category markers, categories, and inflectional classes. It studies the interaction of the principles which determine the structure of inflectional systems and manifest morphological naturalness. It shows how universal morphological naturalness principles interact with language-particular properties of inflectional systems. It also shows how extra-morphological factors affect morphological structuring. Furthermore, it explicates the concept of productivity in terms of the stability of inflectional classes. Kager, René. 1999. Optimality Theory. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. This is one of the most influential textbooks on conventional OT. It introduces both the central idea and general architecture of OT. It explicates many important OT notions such as markedness constraints, rankings of constraints, optimality, and so on. It covers many important topics that center on OT such as the typology of changes of phonological structures, generalized alignment, metrical structures, reduplication, output-to-output correspondence, and opacity. It focuses on (morpho-) phonology within OT, but also spends two chapters discussing OT’s extensions to syntax and language acquisition. Yip, Moira. 1998. Identity avoidance in phonology and morphology. Morphology and its relation to phonology and syntax, ed. by S. G. Lapointe, D. K. Brentari and P. M. Farrell, 216–46. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. This article argues for an OT approach to avoidance of sequences of homophonous elements. It proposes a constraint-based model that incorporates both OCP-type constraints and realization constraints. It shows that the effects of OCP are cross-linguistically observed while each particular language has its own instantiation of the general OCP constraint. The rankings of OCP-type constraints with other markedness constraints predict a typology of cases that either forbid or allow for sequences of homophonous elements. Additionally, it shows that some morpho-syntactic features must not be realized in the input in order for this model to work. Furthermore, it remarks that there is no clear-cut divide between morphology and phonology, i.e. phonological effects can be observed in the morphological component while morphological information is necessary for many phonological operations. Xu, Zheng, and Mark Aronoff. forthcoming. A Realization Optimality Theory approach to blocking and extended morphological exponence. Journal of Linguistics, doi: 10.1017/S002222671100003X. Blocking in inflection occurs when a morphological exponent prevents the application of another exponent expressing the same feature value, thus barring the occurrence of multiple exponents of a single morpho-syntactic feature value. In instances of extended exponence, more than one exponent in the same word realizes the same feature value. In this article, Xu and Aronoff provide a unified account of blocking and extended exponence that combines a realizational approach to inflection with OT (Realization OT), encoding morphological realization rules as ranked violable constraints. The markedness constraint *Feature Split bars the realization of any morpho-syntactic feature value by more than one exponent. If *Feature Split ranks lower than two or more realization constraints expressing the same feature value, then extended exponence will occur. Otherwise, blocking of lower ranked exponents will be observed. They discuss the framework of Realization OT in this article and show that this framework is superior to various alternative approaches to blocking and extended morphological exponence. Online Materials 1 http://roa.rutgers.edu/ Rutgers Optimality Archive is the most well-known website about OT. It was established and maintained by Rutgers University. Scholars who work on OT around the world keep posting their up-to-date works on this website, which has a good search function so that the user can search for OT-related papers based on authors, paper titles, key words, and linguistic sub-disciplines. The user can find many classical OT works there. The authors who post their works on this website often receive feedbacks from their readers. 2 http://www.linguistlist.org The Linguist List is one of the most well-known linguistics websites. It houses a myriad of important resources including information about various types of publications such as books, book reviews, dissertations, academic papers, and so on. This publication information is nicely sorted out, which makes it easy for users to search for their desired information. After searching, you can find that this website lists many publications on morphology. 3 http://wals.info/ The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) Online is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of leading scholars. It supersedes previous versions of WALS and is a joint effort of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Max Planck Digital Library. It comprises more than one hundred and forty chapters, each of which describes the typology of a specific language property. Additionally, the languages in its database are classified in terms of “feature values” or scalar properties. For example, each of the languages is categorized based on the size of its consonant inventory, which is assumed to be a feature by WALS. Each of them is labelled with a symbol on a map, which represents its feature value (small, moderately small, average, moderately large, or large). This website contains a lot of information about the morphology of diverse languages. 4 http://www.surrey.ac.uk/english/smg/ The website of the preeminent Surrey Morphology Group (SMG) is a very valuable and important one of morphology. It lists a series of SMG research projects and their outputs. It also houses several important databases that were established and maintained by SMG. These databases that are based on typological surveys cover several morphological phenomena such as agreement, deponency, defectiveness, suppletion, and syncretism. The user can search for the data of each phenomenon on a language-specific basis. Complete bibliographies on each of these phenomena are also listed on this website. 5 http://www.ethnologue.com/ Ethnologue: Languages of the world is an encyclopedic reference work cataloging all of the world’s 6909 known living languages. It has both a web and print version. On its website, you can find out detailed descriptive and statistical information about each language in terms of where it is spoken, how many people speak it, and which language family it belongs to. The Ethnologue also has a full bibliography referencing each language in its database. This website will be useful for scholars to investigate the morphology of many languages. Sample Unit The following portion of a syllabus is designed to fit into a course on morphology. Although it starts as ‘Week I’, it is better for this partial syllabus to be inserted into the course schedule later in the semester. The syllabus reflects a logical development of the topic on OT and morphology with three sessions introducing three closely related theoretical models: classical rule-based frameworks of morphology, conventional OT, and Realization OT that encodes realization rules as constraints. The goal of the syllabus is not only to make students familiar with the general architecture of the above models and understand why OT should be applied to morphology, but also to arouse their interests in doing future research in OT morphology. The class is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students who have mastered basic linguistic knowledge, i.e. have taken introductory linguistics courses and are therefore familiar with basic linguistic terms. Week I: Classical rule-based frameworks of morphology During this week, students learn about classical rule-based frameworks of morphology. For example, they learn about the definition and formulation of rules of realization as well as the principles that govern both the application and arrangement of these rules. Suggested readings Zwicky, Arnold M. 1985. How to describe inflection, ed. by M. Niepokuj, M. van Clay, V. Nikiforidou and D. Feder. Proceedings of the Berkeley Linguistic Society (BLS) 11. 372–86. Aronoff, Mark. 1994. Morphology by itself: stems and inflectional classes, Chapters 1, 2, 3. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 5–87. Stump, Gregory T. 2001. Inflectional morphology: a theory of paradigm structure, Chapters 1, 2, 5. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1–61, 139–67. Suggested Learning Exercise Learning exercise \# 1 (see below for details) Week II: Naturalness and Optimality Theory During this week, students study the notion of naturalness in morphology and other linguistic sub-disciplines. Additionally, they learn about the general architecture of OT, which encodes naturalness or unmarkedness in constraint rankings. For example, they learn about the types of constraints proposed in conventional OT as well as the principles that govern their rankings. Suggested readings Wurzel, Wolfgang Ullrich. 1989. Inflectional morphology and naturalness, Chapters 1, 2, 3. Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1–73. Kager, René. 1999. Optimality Theory, Chapter 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1–48. Suggested Learning Exercise Learning exercise \# 2 (see below for details) Week III: Realization Optimality Theory This is the week when students learn about Realization OT, a constraint-based framework of morphology. They learn about the architectural assumptions of Realization OT. Additionally, in comparison with alternative frameworks such as rule-based morphological models and conventional OT, they learn about the advantages of Realization OT in tackling various morphological issues such as syncretism, affix ordering, blocking and extended exponence, avoidance of adjacent phonologically (partially) identical forms. Suggested readings Xu, Zheng. 2011. Optimality Theory and Morphology. Language and Linguistics Compass 5/7. 466–84. Yip, Moira. 1998. Identity avoidance in phonology and morphology. Morphology and its relation to phonology and syntax, ed. by S. G. Lapointe, D. K. Brentari and P. M. Farrell, 216–46. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. Xu, Zheng, and Mark Aronoff. forthcoming. A Realization Optimality Theory approach to blocking and extended morphological exponence. Journal of Linguistics, doi: 10.1017/S002222671100003X. Suggested Learning Exercise Learning exercise \# 3 (see below for details) Focus Questions 1 What is the definition and formulation of a rule of realization? What are the principles that govern the application and arrangement of rules of realization? 2 How is naturalness defined in a morphological framework such as Wurzel 1989? 3 What is the definition and formulation of a markedness constraint? What types of constraints does conventional OT propose? What are the principles that govern the application and ranking of constraints? 4 What is the definition and formulation of a realization constraint? What are the basic assumptions of Realization OT? 5 In comparison with rule-based frameworks of morphology and conventional OT, what advantages does Realization OT bring about in accounting for, for example, syncretism, blocking and extended morphological exponence, avoidance of adjacent phonologically (partially) identical forms? Learning Exercises Learning exercise \# 1: Understanding rule-based morphology The purpose of this exercise is to make students grasp the basic assumptions and formulations of rule-based morphology. Ask students to use the above websites to find a language with relatively rich inflectional morphology. Then ask them to use a framework such as Stump 2001 to account for its inflectional morphology and then discuss the problems and issues that arise in their formulations. Learning exercise \# 2: Understanding conventional OT The purpose of this exercise is to make students understand the fundamental tenets of conventional OT, which encodes naturalness or unmarkedness in constraint rankings. The instructor can choose one or two exercises in a textbook such as Kager 1999 for the students to practise constraint rankings and OT tableaux. Additionally, ask students to think about whether conventional OT can extend to the inflectional morphology in the previous exercise. Learning exercise \# 3: Understanding Realization OT The purpose of this exercise is to make students understand both the architectural assumptions of Realization OT and the reasons to propose such a theory. Ask students to use Realization OT to account for the inflectional morphology in the first learning exercise. Then ask them to compare the formulations of both rule-based morphology and Realization OT and discuss the (dis)advantages of each framework.},

This analysis explains the edge effects associated with such segments, while simultaneously identifying them as single melodic elements that associate as units to prosodic templates. This paper will argue that some languages have contour tones that show parallel properties to those of affricates: they associate as units, but also exhibit edge effects. Such behaviour can be simply understood if tonal features hang off a tonal root node (Archangeli \& Pulleyblank forthcoming), and this tonal root node is allowed to branch. A high rising contour tone will have the structure shown in (i), where [upper] is the tonal root node, and [raised] is free to branch.},

  abstract = {Baker (2015) suggests that the dependent theory of case (Marantz 1991, a.o.) is a formulation of the intuition that morphological case functions to differentiate nominals. This paper presents novel evidence for this idea from the agreement system of Yimas. Departing from previous characterizations of the language, this paper argues that the Yimas agreement morphemes are actually doubled pronominal clitics, and that they exhibit paradigmatic alternations that parallel the distributions of dependent case on nominals crosslinguistically. Crucially, clitic doubling in Yimas is optional; once this is taken into account, it is revealed that the morphological form of a given clitic co-varies with the total number of clitics present, even when the sentence-level syntax is held constant: how a clitic is realized is thus dependent on its clitic environment. This context-dependence is analyzed as a dissimilation process, which applies to distinguish between multiple morphosyntactically indistinguishable clitics; this arises whenever multiple DPs are doubled. Thus, both clitic dissimilation in Yimas and dependent case on nominals can be viewed as alternations that are controlled by morphosyntactic context, albeit in different structural domains.},

  abstract = {Samoan is an ergative-marking, (reportedly) non-tonal Polynesian language in which ergative case is marked segmentally, but absolutive case has been said to be unmarked. This paper shows that in fact, a high edge tone co-occurs with absolutive arguments, based on converging evidence from the phonetic and phonological analysis of intonational patterns in the spoken utterances of a systematically varied set of syntactic structures. This empirical observation raises puzzles that probe the nature of the syntax-prosody interface and the relation between tone and intonation: what is the relation between this absolutive high edge tone and: (i) other case markers in Samoan, which are all segmental?, and (ii) other high edge tones in Samoan that co-occur with fronted expressions and coordination? I propose that: (i)~the absolutive high edge tone is a tonal case marker that may be related to an apparently moribund stressed, segmental absolutive particle [ˈia], (ii) the high tones that co-occur with absolutives, fronting, and coordination are all syntactically determined and each inserted in the spellout of distinct syntactic configurations, and (iii) there is another class of edge tones which reliably co-occur with pauses—intonational phrase boundary tones—that are not inserted in spellout but by the phonological grammar. While my proposal may seem surprising at first, I show that it fits the current data better than any alternative.},

If all underlying material has to be present in the output form, replacing two input elements with a single output element is not straightforward. I argue that, under the assumptions of Autosegmental Coloured Containment Theory, a distinct operation of coalescence is unnecessary, as all major types of coalescence patterns can be analysed in terms of (i) adding new association lines between some autosegmental nodes, and (ii) the underparsing of other nodes, leading to their phonetic non-realisation. The proposed analysis accurately reflects the heterogeneity of coalescence alternations, which are shown to fall into three different types.},

However, structures that are frequent across languages are also typically the most frequent within a specific language. This confounding of cross-linguistic and language-specific data is consistent with the hypothesis that children acquire the grammar of the specific languages to which they are exposed, based on a less constrained acquisition mechanism (Specific Language Grammar Hypothesis—SLGH). These two theories of acquisition are contrasted in an examination of English-speaking children’s acquisition of codas. Predictions for the UGH were based on crosslinguistic patterns and on frequency analyses of codas from 35 languages. Results showed that languages prefer coronal and sonorant codas; however, children’s productions did not favor these codas. Predictions for the SLGH were established on the frequency of English codas, and significant correlations were found between children’s coda productions and the frequency of English codas.},

The two classes have overlapping syntactic distributions, yet exhibit clear prosodic differences. Free functional elements may become prosodic words if they are minimally disyllabic, or if focused, and in this they crucially differ from clitics, whose only prosodic option is to be included into the host prosodic word. It is argued that the prosodic properties of the two classes of function words cannot be captured by a single set of ranked constraints, and that one of the classes, the class of clitics, needs to be encoded lexically, by virtue of prosodic prespecification. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

By taking into account what is known′ as the sonority of segments, their arrangement within the syllable follows a clear pattern: the most sonorous segment occupies the peak position, while the less sonorous ones occur towards the margins, as observed in a wide range of literature (Jespersen 1904; Saussure 1916; Zwicky 1972; Hooper 1976; Kiparsky 1979, 1981; Lowenstamm 1981; Steriade 1982; Selkirk 1984; Clements 1990). This specific arrangement of segments within the syllable has been attributed in the previous literature to the principle of sonority sequencing, which relegates segments low in sonority towards syllable margins (see Hooper 1976; Kiparsky 1979, 1981; Steriade 1982; Selkirk 1984; Levin 1985; Clements 1990).},

Many languages may also use negative indefinites (such as English nobody or nothing) to express negation. The behavior of these negative indefinites is subject to crosslinguistic variation: In some languages, negative markers and negative indefinites cannot express a single semantic negation (nobody didn’t come means that everybody came and not that nobody came), but in other languages they can. Languages with these properties, such as Italian, are called Negative Concord languages. In this review, I discuss the difference between negative indefinites in languages that exhibit Negative Concord and languages that do not. I also compare the behaviors of negative indefinites in languages that exhibit Negative Concord and so-called Negative Polarity Items. This article provides an accurate overview of recent developments in the study of negation and negative dependencies.},

Sentences like German Du must keine Krawatte anziehen (‘you must wear no tie’) have a reading where the modal takes scope in between the negation and the indefinite. In this paper I argue that West Germanic NIs are not negative quantifiers (in the Montegovian sense), but complex syntactic structures that consist of an abstract negative operator and an indefinite that are spelled out as a single word. Split-scope effects result from application of the copy theory of movement. I argue that in split-scope constructions, though they are spelled out as a single word, after Quantifier Raising the negative operator is interpreted in a higher copy and the indefinite in a lower copy of the NI. Furthermore I demonstrate that alternative analyses that take NIs in Dutch and German to be negative quantifiers, n-words, or the result of amalgamation or incorporation processes face problems that the analysis presented in this paper does not encounter.},

They argue that Korean language-internal variation with respect to the scopal order between negation and universal quantifier objects shows that in the variety where negation takes wide scope, the negative marker must have moved along with the verb/auxiliary to the head of IP. This would then constitute evidence for rightward string-adjacent head movement. In this paper, I argue that this analysis actually makes different predictions than have been attested in Korean. Moreover, I argue that, following a well-known stand with respect to the nature of polarity-sensitivity (Chierchia 2013), these facts follow naturally once it is assumed that in one variety but not the other, universal quantifiers are Positive Polarity Items (PPIs). This makes the attested language-internal variation in Korean less exceptional since language-internal variation with respect to polarity-sensitivity is something that can be widely attested.},

  abstract = {Mecapalapa Tepehua (ISO code: tee) is a language of Mexico that belongs to the Huehuetla branch of the Totonac-Tepehua linguistic family. It is spoken in the town of Mecapalapa, Puebla, Mexico. This linguistic family is composed of the Tepehua and Totonac branches (see MacKay \& Trechsel 2014 and references there). The Tepehua branch consists of three main languages and their respective varieties: Pisaflores and Tlachichilco Tepehua are located in Veracruz, and Huehuetla Tepehua is located in Hidalgo and Puebla (see Figure~1). In comparison with Totonac, Tepehua has been poorly studied (see a comprehensive list of references in MacKay \& Trechsel 2012). Representative works include Watters (1988), on Tlachichilco morpho-syntax with a brief phonological survey; Gutiérrez, Jiménez \& García (2013), on a Tepehua-Spanish vocabulary, which is a vocabulary for the Tepehua variety spoken in Tlachichilco; MacKay \& Trechsel (2013, 2018), providing detailed accounts of the phonological structures of Pisaflores and discussion of previous reconstructions of proto-Totonac-Tepehua sounds; and Kryder (1987) and Smythe (2007), offering a detailed description of Huehuetla phonology.},

This assumption allows to predict the attested interactions between phonological markedness constraints and the (non)appearance of ghost segments we find in the languages of the world: first, the co-existence of different types of ghost segments that differ in whether they~appear~to resolve a markedness problem or whether they~disappear~to avoid a markedness problem, and, second, the~weak contribution to markedness~of ghosts. The assumption that all underlying phonological elements have a certain activation that can gradiently differ and might persist into the output structure predicts these two phenomena straightforwardly that are challenging under alternative accounts to ghost segments},

  abstract = {This dissertation proposes a new model of subsegmental phonology within Optimality Theory that differs from standard Auto segmental Phonology both in its limited use of representational distinctions and in the form of the grammar to which the representations submit. The research focuses particularly on phonological units which are invisible to parsing in certain contexts, such as floating features and ghost segments, and demonstrates that the current understanding of segmental representation does not adequately characterize the full range of subsegmental phenomena found cross-linguistically. I propose instead an analysis in the framework of Optimality Theory in which the grammar derives the variety of surface phenomena from a single underlying representation. The typology which results from this analysis correctly classifies the entire range of behavior associated with subminimal phonological units while allowing a unique characterization of the immunity of defective segments from the demands of regular parsing. This dissertation thus both enlarges the empirical foundation on which an adequate theory of segment structure must be based, and in developing such an account sheds new light on classic problems of subsegmental parsing.},

  abstract = {"Is speech in the mouth or in the brain? Do we hear with our ears or our minds? The answer is: both. The sounds of language are both physical objects and cognitive constructs. The physical aspects of speech are the province of phonetics: sound waves that are produced by the movement of articulators and received by the ear. Phonology, by contrast, studies cognitive aspects: systematic patterns in the ways that languages combine sounds to create meaning. Many books look at phonology and phonetics as separate disciplines. This book looks at the interaction between the two. The Phonology/Phonetics Interface examines classic and current linguistic theories--including structuralist, derivational, and post-derivational approaches--to explore how physical and cognitive factors interact in the mind of the speaker and in the language system as a whole. The patterns of phonology are often clearly dependent on the principles of phonetics, yet they can also diverge from them in sometimes complex ways. The book examines the roles of both articulation and perception in creating and maintaining phonological patterns. Chapters are organized thematically around central issues, such as categorization or abstraction, presented roughly in the order in which these issues rose to the forefront of linguistic theorizing, providing historical perspective without adhering to a completely chronological presentation. Each chapter ends with discussion questions and references for further reading. The book is suitable for students in advanced courses and as an overview for professionals and scholars."--Publisher's website},

  abstract = {Latin verbs appear to both obey and disobey the Mirror Generalization (Baker 1985), albeit in different inflectional forms (Cinque 1999). Given the importance of the Mirror Generalization to morphosyntactic theorizing, this situation deserves scrutiny. We develop an analysis on which all Latin finite verbs, whether mirroring or anti-mirroring, share a single, simple, virtually invariant derivation, involving one step of head movement (Asp to T) and one step of phrasal movement (vP to [Spec,TP]). On this analysis, the Mirror Generalization is valid for Latin, despite appearances, but it is crucially about structures formed by operations on heads: phrasal movement can give rise to apparent violations of it (Myler 2017). The analysis extends readily to nonfinite forms, solving an anti-mirroring paradox arising among the participles. It also makes correct syntactic predictions. When the verb word is a constituent, it is a TP, and the analysis correctly predicts that it should move as a phrase, not as a head. The analysis also makes correct predictions about the positions of vP-adjuncts, and is fully compatible with what is known about leftward argument movement out of vP. Finally, unlike two competing analyses (Embick 2000; Calabrese 2019), it accounts for anti-mirroring in Latin without any stipulations placing passive Voice in an unexpectedly peripheral position within the verb word. The larger picture that emerges is one in which phonological words need not correspond to syntactic constituents, but can instead be reflexes of linearly contiguous series of morphemes suspended across potentially vast regions of syntactic space (Julien 2002).},

  abstract = {Traditional theories of phonological variation propose that morphemes be encoded with descriptors such as [+/- Rule X], to capture which of them participate in a variable process. More recent theories predict that morphemes can have LEXICAL PROPENSITIES: idiosyncratic, gradient rates at which they participate in a process-e.g., [0.7 Rule X]. This dissertation argues that such propensities exist, and that a binary distinction is not rich enough to characterize participation in variable processes. Corpus investigations into Slovenian palatalization and French liaison reveal that individual morphemes pattern across an entire propensity spectrum, and that encoding individual morphemes with gradient status improves model performance. Furthermore, an experimental investigation into French speakers' intuitions suggests that they internalize word- specific propensities to undergo liaison. The dissertation turns to modeling language learners' ability to acquire the idiosyncratic behavior of individual attested morphemes while frequency matching to statistical generalizations across the lexicon. A recent model based in Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar (MaxEnt) makes use of general constraints that putatively capture statistical generalizations across the lexicon, as well as lexical constraints governing the behavior of individual words. A series of learning simulations reveals that the approach fails to learn statistical generalizations across the lexicon: lexical constraints are so powerful that the learner comes to acquire the behavior of each attested form using only these constraints, at which point the general constraint is rendered ineffective. A GENERALITY BIAS is therefore attributed to learners, whereby they privilege general constraints over lexical ones. It is argued that MaxEnt fails to represent this property in its current formulation, and that it be replaced with the hierarchical MIXED-EFFECTS LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL (MIXED-EFFECTS MAXENT), which is shown to succeed in learning both a frequency-matching grammar and lexical propensities, by encoding general constraints as fixed effects and lexical constraints as a random effect. The learner treats the grammar and lexicon differently, in that vocabulary effects are subordinated to broad, grammatical effects in the learning process.},
